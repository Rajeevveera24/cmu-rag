        "Title": " SPAE Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs",
        "Abstract": " In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%.",

        "Title": " HomeRobot Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation",
        "Abstract": " HomeRobot (noun) An affordable compliant robot that navigates homes and manipulates a wide range of objects in order to complete everyday tasks. Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) is the problem of picking any object in any unseen environment, and placing it in a commanded location. This is a foundational challenge for robots to be useful assistants in human environments, because it involves tackling sub-problems from across robotics perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation are all essential to OVMM. In addition, integration of the solutions to these sub-problems poses its own substantial challenges. To drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new, high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, providing a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage replication of real-world experiments across labs. We implement both reinforcement learning and heuristic (model-based) baselines and show evidence of sim-to-real transfer. Our baselines achieve a 20% success rate in the real world; our experiments identify ways future research work improve performance. See videos on our website https//ovmm.github.io/.",

        "Title": " Plan, Eliminate, and Track - Language Models are Good Teachers for Embodied Agents",
        "Abstract": " Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) capture procedural knowledge about the world. Recent work has leveraged LLM's ability to generate abstract plans to simplify challenging control tasks, either by action scoring, or action modeling (fine-tuning). However, the transformer architecture inherits several constraints that make it difficult for the LLM to directly serve as the agent e.g. limited input lengths, fine-tuning inefficiency, bias from pre-training, and incompatibility with non-text environments. To maintain compatibility with a low-level trainable actor, we propose to instead use the knowledge in LLMs to simplify the control problem, rather than solving it. We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module translates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. On the AlfWorld instruction following benchmark, the PET framework leads to a significant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal specifications.",

        "Title": " MOSAIC Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception",
        "Abstract": " A holistic understanding of object properties across diverse sensory modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and haptic) is essential for tasks ranging from object categorization to complex manipulation. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science studies that emphasize the significance of multi-sensory integration in human perception, we introduce MOSAIC (Multi-modal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Integrated Comprehension), a novel framework designed to facilitate the learning of unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from the extensive pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, aligning these representations not only across vision but also haptic and auditory sensory modalities. Through extensive experiments on a dataset where a humanoid robot interacts with 100 objects across 10 exploratory behaviors, we demonstrate the versatility of MOSAIC in two task families object categorization and object-fetching tasks. Our results underscore the efficacy of MOSAIC's unified representations, showing competitive performance in category recognition through a simple linear probe setup and excelling in the fetch object task under zero-shot transfer conditions. This work pioneers the application of CLIP-based sensory grounding in robotics, promising a significant leap in multi-sensory perception capabilities for autonomous systems. We have released the code, datasets, and additional results https//github.com/gtatiya/MOSAIC.",

        "Title": " Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation",
        "Abstract": " Robots should exist anywhere humans do indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped environments. In contrast, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation(OGN) has targeted navigating in indoor environments by leveraging spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. While these contributions provide valuable insights into indoor scenarios, the broader spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings. As we transition to the vast and complex terrains of outdoor environments, new challenges emerge. Unlike the structured layouts found indoors, outdoor environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. Despite this, humans navigate with ease because we can reason about the unseen. We introduce a new task OUTDOOR, a new mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures, and a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain. Additionally, we show impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments. Our agent has no premapping and our formalism outperforms naive LLM-based approaches",

        "Title": " The Framework Tax Disparities Between Inference Efficiency in Research and Deployment",
        "Abstract": " Increased focus on the computational efficiency of NLP systems has motivated the design of efficient model architectures and improvements to underlying hardware accelerators. However, the resulting increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations have not directly translated to improvements in wall-clock inference latency. We demonstrate that these discrepancies can be largely attributed to bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks. We denote this phenomenon as the \\textit{framework tax}, and observe that the disparity is growing as hardware speed increases over time. In this work, we examine this phenomenon through a series of case studies analyzing the effects of model design decisions, framework paradigms, and hardware platforms on total model latency.

        "Title": " Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind",
        "Abstract": " Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition.",

Modeling the conversation with entity graphs and predicting each entity's centrality in the conversation provides additional information that improves the retrieval of answer passages for the current question. Experiments show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines.",

        "Abstract": " Recent research has proposed retrieval approaches based on sparse representations and inverted indexes, with terms produced by neural language models and leveraging the advantages from both neural retrieval and lexical matching. This paper proposes KALE, a new lightweight method of this family that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary. The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts than perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary, this way improving first-stage retrieval accuracy. Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR datasets, examined the effectiveness of KALE under varying conditions. Results show that the KALE terms can replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency. Combining KALE with the original lexical vocabulary, or with other learned terms, can further improve retrieval accuracy with only a modest increase in computational cost.",

        "Title": " CSurF Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms",
        "Abstract": " Lexical exact-match systems perform text retrieval efficiently with sparse matching signals and fast retrieval through inverted lists, but naturally suffer from the mismatch between lexical surface form and implicit term semantics. This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF). Each CSF pairs a lexical surface form with a context source, and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework is able to perform sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a \"bag-of-CSFs\", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring. Multiple experiments show that this approach successfully resolves the main mismatch issues in lexical exact-match retrieval and outperforms state-of-the-art lexical exact-match systems, reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an efficient exact-match-based system.",

        "Title": " Why do Nearest Neighbor Language Models Work?",
        "Abstract": " Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this representation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these representations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous context. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over standard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore, in addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and specifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these insights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard parametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval component.

        "Abstract": " Recent advances in large language models have prompted researchers to examine their abilities across a variety of linguistic tasks, but little has been done to investigate how models handle the interactions in meaning across words and larger syntactic forms\u2014i.e. phenomena at the intersection of syntax and semantics. We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions. We created a novel evaluation dataset by utilitizing the unique linguistic properties of a subset of optionally transitive English verbs. This dataset was used to prompt varying sizes of three model classes to see if they are sensitive to agentivity at the lexical level, and if they can appropriately employ these word-level priors given a specific syntactic context. Overall, GPT-3 text-davinci-003 performs extremely well across all experiments, outperforming all other models tested by far. In fact, the results are even better correlated with human judgements than both syntactic and semantic corpus statistics. This suggests that LMs may potentially serve as more useful tools for linguistic annotation, theory testing, and discovery than select corpora for certain tasks.",

        "Title": " DataFinder Scientific Dataset Recommendation from Natural Language Descriptions",
        "Abstract": " Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas. Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult. Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.",

        "Title": " Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Figurative Language Understanding",
        "Abstract": " Figurative language permeates human communication, but at the same time is relatively understudied in NLP. Datasets have been created in English to accelerate progress towards measuring and improving figurative language processing in language models (LMs). However, the use of figurative language is an expression of our cultural and societal experiences, making it difficult for these phrases to be universally applicable. In this work, we create a figurative language inference dataset, \\datasetname, for seven diverse languages associated with a variety of cultures Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for figurative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages originating from the same region. We assess multilingual LMs' abilities to interpret figurative language in zero-shot and few-shot settings. All languages exhibit a significant deficiency compared to English, with variations in performance reflecting the availability of pre-training and fine-tuning data, emphasizing the need for LMs to be exposed to a broader range of linguistic and cultural variation during training.",

        "Abstract": " Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a method for choosing the outputs of a machine learning system based not on the output with the highest probability, but the output with the lowest risk (expected error) among multiple candidates. It is a simple but powerful method for an additional cost at inference time, MBR provides reliable several-point improvements across metrics for a wide variety of tasks without any additional data or training. Despite this, MBR is not frequently applied in NLP works, and knowledge of the method itself is limited. We first provide an introduction to the method and the recent literature. We show that several recent methods that do not reference MBR can be written as special cases of MBR; this reformulation provides additional theoretical justification for the performance of these methods, explaining some results that were previously only empirical. We provide theoretical and empirical results about the effectiveness of various MBR variants and make concrete recommendations for the application of MBR in NLP models, including future directions in this area.",

        "Title": " Unlimiformer Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input",
        "Abstract": " Since the proposal of transformers, these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code. We make our code and models publicly available at https//github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer .",

        "Abstract": " Large language models (LLMs) enable system builders today to create competent NLP systems through prompting, where they only need to describe the task in natural language and provide a few examples. However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment.

        "Abstract": " Modern abstractive summarization models often generate summaries that contain hallucinated or contradictory information. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective contrastive learning framework that incorporates recent developments in reward learning and factuality metrics. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed framework enables summarization models to learn from feedback of factuality metrics using contrastive reward learning, leading to more factual summaries by human evaluations. This suggests that further advances in learning and evaluation algorithms can feed directly into providing more factual summaries. Code and human evaluation results will be publicly available at \\url{https//github.com/EthanC111/factuality_summarization}.",

        "Title": " Active Retrieval Augmented Generation",
        "Abstract": " Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https//github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE.",

        "Abstract": " Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) is a critical tool driving the rapid iterative development of MT systems. While considerable progress has been made on estimating a single scalar quality score, current metrics lack the informativeness of more detailed schemes that annotate individual errors, such as Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). In this paper, we help fill this gap by proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique which leverages the reasoning and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and asks them to identify and categorize errors in translations. We start by evaluating recent LLMs, such as PaLM and PaLM-2, through simple score prediction prompting, and we study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning and finetuning. We then evaluate AutoMQM with PaLM-2 models, and we find that it improves performance compared to just prompting for scores (with particularly large gains for larger models) while providing interpretability through error spans that align with human annotations.",

        "Abstract": " The methods used to create many of the well-known Question-Answering (QA) datasets are hard to replicate for low-resource languages. A commonality amongst these methods is hiring annotators to source answers from the internet by querying a single answer source, such as Wikipedia. Applying these methods for low-resource languages can be problematic since there is no single large answer source for these languages. Consequently, this can result in a high ratio of unanswered questions, since the amount of information in any single source is limited. To address this problem, we developed a novel crowd-sourcing platform to gather multiple-domain QA data for low-resource languages. Our platform, which consists of a mobile app and a web API, gamifies the data collection process. We successfully released the app for Icelandic (a low-resource language with about 350,000 native speakers) to build a dataset which rivals large QA datasets for high-resource languages both in terms of size and ratio of answered questions. We have made the platform open source with instructions on how to localize and deploy it to gather data for other low-resource languages.",

        "Abstract": " We carried out a reproducibility study of InPars, which is a method for unsupervised training of neural rankers (Bonifacio et al., 2022). As a by-product, we developed InPars-light, which is a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM, which -- as we found out -- produced more accurate rankers compared to a proprietary GPT-3 model. On all five English retrieval collections (used in the original InPars study) we obtained substantial (7%-30%) and statistically significant improvements over BM25 (in nDCG and MRR) using only a 30M parameter six-layer MiniLM-30M ranker and a single three-shot prompt. In contrast, in the InPars study only a 100x larger monoT5-3B model consistently outperformed BM25, whereas their smaller monoT5-220M model (which is still 7x larger than our MiniLM ranker) outperformed BM25 only on MS MARCO and TREC DL 2020. In the same three-shot prompting scenario, our 435M parameter DeBERTA v3 ranker was at par with the 7x larger monoT5-3B (average gain over BM25 of 1.3 vs 1.32) In fact, on three out of five datasets, DeBERTA slightly outperformed monoT5-3B. Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022). We believe that InPars-light is the first truly cost-effective prompt-based unsupervised recipe to train and deploy neural ranking models that outperform BM25.

Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.",

In this work, we propose a modular retriever where individual modules correspond to key skills that can be reused across datasets. Our approach supports flexible skill configurations based on the target domain to boost performance. To mitigate task interference, we design a novel modularization parameterization inspired by sparse Transformer. We demonstrate that our model can benefit from self-supervised pretraining on Wikipedia and fine-tuning using multiple ODQA datasets, both in a multi-task fashion.

However, while most approaches randomly mask tokens, there is strong intuition that deciding what to mask can substantially improve learning outcomes. We investigate this in continued pretraining setting in which pretrained models continue to pretrain on domain-specific data before performing some downstream task. We introduce Difference-Masking, a masking strategy that automatically chooses what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain different from the pretraining domain. Empirically, we find that Difference-Masking outperforms baselines on continued pretraining settings across four diverse language-only and multimodal video tasks.",

        "Title": " Using Implicit Feedback to Improve Question Generation",
        "Abstract": " Question Generation (QG) is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims at automatically generating questions from text. Many applications can benefit from automatically generated questions, but often it is necessary to curate those questions, either by selecting or editing them. This task is informative on its own, but it is typically done post-generation, and, thus, the effort is wasted. In addition, most existing systems cannot incorporate this feedback back into them easily. In this work, we present a system, GEN, that learns from such (implicit) feedback. Following a pattern-based approach, it takes as input a small set of sentence/question pairs and creates patterns which are then applied to new unseen sentences. Each generated question, after being corrected by the user, is used as a new seed in the next iteration, so more patterns are created each time. We also take advantage of the corrections made by the user to score the patterns and therefore rank the generated questions. Results show that GEN is able to improve by learning from both levels of implicit feedback when compared to the version with no learning, considering the top 5, 10, and 20 questions. Improvements go up from 10%, depending on the metric and strategy used.",

We address the two main challenges in abstractive summarization": " how to evaluate the performance of a summarization model and what is a good training objective. We first introduce new evaluation measures based on the semantic similarity of the input and corresponding summary. The similarity scores are obtained by the fine-tuned BERTurk model using either the cross-encoder or a bi-encoder architecture. The fine-tuning is done on the Turkish Natural Language Inference and Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark datasets. We show that these measures have better correlations with human evaluations compared to Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores and BERTScore. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the proposed semantic similarity measures as rewards, together with a mixed training objective, in order to generate more natural summaries in terms of human readability. We show that training with a mixed training objective function compared to only the maximum-likelihood objective improves similarity scores.",

Previous work on automated improvement of non-functional properties in mobile apps failed to address the inherent trade-offs between such properties. We propose a practical approach and the first open-source tool, GIDroid (2023), for multi-objective automated improvement of Android apps. In particular, we use Genetic improvement, a search-based technique that navigates the space of software variants to find improved software. We use a simulation-based testing framework to greatly improve the speed of search. GIDroid contains three state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, and two new mutation operators, which cache the results of method calls. Genetic improvement relies on testing to validate patches. Previous work showed that tests in open-source Android applications are scarce. We thus wrote tests for 21 versions of 7 Android apps, creating a new benchmark for performance improvements. We used GIDroid to improve versions of mobile apps where developers had previously found improvements to runtime, memory, and bandwidth use. Our technique automatically re-discovers 64% of existing improvements. We then applied our approach to current versions of software in which there were no known improvements. We were able to improve execution time by up to 35%, and memory use by up to 33% in these apps.",

We extend this work by exploring the impact of linguistic representations on cross-domain performance in a few-shot transfer setting. An important question is whether linguistic representations enhance generalizability by providing features that function as cross-domain pivots. We focus on the task of relation extraction on three datasets of procedural text in two domains, cooking and materials science. Our approach augments a popular transformer-based architecture by alternately incorporating syntactic and semantic graphs constructed by freely available off-the-shelf tools. We examine their utility for enhancing generalization, and investigate whether earlier findings, e.g. that semantic representations can be more helpful than syntactic ones, extend to relation extraction in multiple domains. We find that while the inclusion of these graphs results in significantly higher performance in few-shot transfer, both types of graph exhibit roughly equivalent utility.",

Previous work either treats this task as a series of independent multiple-choice problems, in which the link existence and relations are decoded separately, or the encoding is restricted to only local interaction, ignoring the holistic structural information. In contrast, we propose a principled method that improves upon previous work from two perspectives encoding and decoding. From the encoding side, we perform structured encoding on the adjacency matrix followed by the matrix-tree learning algorithm, where all discourse links and relations in the dialogue are jointly optimized based on latent tree-level distribution. From the decoding side, we perform structured inference using the modified Chiu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, which explicitly generates the labeled multi-root non-projective spanning tree that best captures the discourse structure. In addition, unlike in previous work, we do not rely on hand-crafted features; this improves the model\u2019s robustness.

These elements are processed into a vector representation of the previous turns, which serves as input to several machine learning models, including MLP and LSTM. The results show that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model\u2019s performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges by using Shapley values for feature explanation. We discover that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction. We further validate this observation through a follow-up ablation study.",

        "Abstract": " The advent and fast development of neural networks have revolutionized the research on dialogue systems and subsequently have triggered various challenges regarding their automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems as an open challenge has been the center of the attention of many researchers. Despite the consistent efforts to improve automatic metrics\u2019 correlations with human evaluation, there have been very few attempts to assess their robustness over multiple domains and dimensions. Also, their focus is mainly on the English language. All of these challenges prompt the development of automatic evaluation metrics that are reliable in various domains, dimensions, and languages. This track in the 11th Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC11) is part of the ongoing effort to promote robust and multilingual automatic evaluation metrics. This article describes the datasets and baselines provided to participants and discusses the submission and result details of the two proposed subtasks.",

The framework learns to pair the best question generation (QG) strategy with in-domain question answering (QA) methods to extract slot values from a dialogue without any human intervention. A novel self-supervised QA pretraining step using in-domain data is essential to learn the structure without requiring any slot-filling annotations. Moreover, we show that QG methods need to be aligned with the same grammatical person used in the dialogue. Empirical evaluation on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset demonstrates that our approach, when used alongside robust QA models, outperforms existing zero-shot methods in the challenging task of zero-shot cross domain adaptation-given a comparable amount of domain knowledge during data creation. Finally, we analyze the impact of the types of questions used, and demonstrate that the algorithmic approach outperforms template-based question generation.",

        "Abstract": " The use of positional embeddings in transformer language models is widely accepted. However, recent research has called into question the necessity of such embeddings. We further extend this inquiry by demonstrating that a randomly initialized and frozen transformer language model, devoid of positional embeddings, inherently encodes strong positional information through the shrinkage of self-attention variance. To quantify this variance, we derive the underlying distribution of each step within a transformer layer. Through empirical validation using a fully pretrained model, we show that the variance shrinkage effect still persists after extensive gradient updates. Our findings serve to justify the decision to discard positional embeddings and thus facilitate more efficient pretraining of transformer language models.",

Inspired by the notion of working memory, we propose a new Transformer variant named RegularGPT. With its novel combination of Weight-Sharing, Adaptive-Depth, and Sliding-Dilated-Attention, RegularGPT constructs working memory along the depth dimension, thereby enabling efficient and successful modeling of regular languages such as PARITY. We further test RegularGPT on the task of natural language length extrapolation and surprisingly find that it rediscovers the local windowed attention effect deemed necessary in prior work for length extrapolation.",

        "Abstract": " The most meaningful connections between people are often fostered through expression of shared vulnerability and emotional experiences in personal narratives. We introduce a new task of identifying similarity in personal stories based on empathic resonance, i.e., the extent to which two people empathize with each others' experiences, as opposed to raw semantic or lexical similarity, as has predominantly been studied in NLP. Using insights from social psychology, we craft a framework that operationalizes empathic similarity in terms of three key features of stories main events, emotional trajectories, and overall morals or takeaways. We create EmpathicStories, a dataset of 1,500 personal stories annotated with our empathic similarity features, and 2,000 pairs of stories annotated with empathic similarity scores. Using our dataset, we fine-tune a model to compute empathic similarity of story pairs, and show that this outperforms semantic similarity models on automated correlation and retrieval metrics. Through a user study with 150 participants, we also assess the effect our model has on retrieving stories that users empathize with, compared to naive semantic similarity-based retrieval, and find that participants empathized significantly more with stories retrieved by our model. Our work has strong implications for the use of empathy-aware models to foster human connection and empathy between people.",

        "Abstract": " Warning This paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Understanding the harms and offensiveness of statements requires reasoning about the social and situational context in which statements are made. For example, the utterance\"your English is very good\"may implicitly signal an insult when uttered by a white man to a non-white colleague, but uttered by an ESL teacher to their student would be interpreted as a genuine compliment. Such contextual factors have been largely ignored by previous approaches to toxic language detection. We introduce COBRA frames, the first context-aware formalism for explaining the intents, reactions, and harms of offensive or biased statements grounded in their social and situational context. We create COBRACORPUS, a dataset of 33k potentially offensive statements paired with machine-generated contexts and free-text explanations of offensiveness, implied biases, speaker intents, and listener reactions. To study the contextual dynamics of offensiveness, we train models to generate COBRA explanations, with and without access to the context. We find that explanations by context-agnostic models are significantly worse than by context-aware ones, especially in situations where the context inverts the statement's offensiveness (29% accuracy drop). Our work highlights the importance and feasibility of contextualized NLP by modeling social factors.",

        "Abstract": " Language Models (LMs) achieve substantial language capabilities when finetuned using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LoL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LoL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM's internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LoL filters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LoL is an easy-to-implement LM training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LoL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LoL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LoL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data.

In reducing the strength of an expression, it may help to avoid embarrassment (more technically, \u201cface threat\u201d) to one\u2019s listener. For this reason, it is often found in contexts of instruction, such as tutoring. In this work, we develop a model of hedge generation based on i) fine-tuning state-of-the-art language models trained on human-human tutoring data, followed by ii) reranking to select the candidate that best matches the expected hedging strategy within a candidate pool using a hedge classifier. We apply this method to a natural peer-tutoring corpus containing a significant number of disfluencies, repetitions, and repairs. The results show that generation in this noisy environment is feasible with reranking. By conducting an error analysis for both approaches, we reveal the challenges faced by systems attempting to accomplish both social and task-oriented goals in conversation.",

For example, the word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d in a sentence such as \u201cwe need to end the cosmopolitan experiment\u201d can mean \u201cworldly\u201d to many but also secretly mean \u201cJewish\u201d to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians\u2019 speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3\u2019s performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detection, highlighting online risks presented by such coded language. This work sheds light on the theoretical and applied importance of dogwhistles in both NLP and computational social science, and provides resources to facilitate future research in modeling dogwhistles and mitigating their online harms.",

We introduce NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and quantifying the positionality of NLP datasets and models. Our framework continuously collects annotations from a diverse pool of volunteer participants on LabintheWild, and statistically quantifies alignment with dataset labels and model predictions. We apply NLPositionality to existing datasets and models for two tasks\u2014social acceptability and hate speech detection. To date, we have collected 16,299 annotations in over a year for 600 instances from 1,096 annotators across 87 countries.We find that datasets and models align predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations. Additionally, certain groups, such as non-binary people and non-native English speakers, are further marginalized by datasets and models as they rank least in alignment across all tasks. Finally, we draw from prior literature to discuss how researchers can examine their own positionality and that of their datasets and models, opening the door for more inclusive NLP systems.",

We comparatively evaluate non-contextual and contextual rewrites in formality, toxicity, and sentiment transfer tasks. Our experiments show that humans significantly prefer contextual rewrites as more fitting and natural over non-contextual ones, yet existing sentence-level automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, SBERT) correlate poorly with human preferences ($\\rho$=0--0.3). In contrast, human preferences are much better reflected by both our novel $\\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ ($\\rho$=0.7--0.9) as well as proposed context-infused versions of common metrics ($\\rho$=0.4--0.7).

        "Abstract": " Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community\u2019s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization\u2019s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI\u2019s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.",

        "Abstract": " Human values are crucial to human decision-making. Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce ValuePrism, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations. ValuePrism's contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With ValuePrism, we build Kaleido, an open, light-weight, and structured language-based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader coverage. In addition, we demonstrate that Kaleido can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that Kaleido's representations transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the implicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them.",

We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities.

In our work, we conduct exploratory studies into the task of countering essentialist beliefs (e.g., ``liberals are stupid''). Drawing on prior work from psychology and NLP, we construct five types of counterstatements and conduct human studies on the effectiveness of these different strategies. Our studies also investigate the role in choosing a counterstatement of the level of explicitness with which an essentialist belief is conveyed. We find that statements that broaden the scope of a stereotype (e.g., to other groups, as in ``conservatives can also be stupid'') are the most popular countering strategy. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions for future work in this area (e.g., improving factuality, studying community-specific variation) and we emphasize the importance of work at the intersection of NLP and psychology.",

However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline.",

In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science.",

        "Title": " A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker\u2019s Voice",
        "Abstract": " Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature\u2014that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in na\u00efve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.",

In peer-tutoring, they are notably used by tutors in dyads experiencing low rapport to tone down the impact of instructions and negative feedback.Pursuing the objective of building a tutoring agent that manages rapport with teenagers in order to improve learning, we used a multimodal peer-tutoring dataset to construct a computational framework for identifying hedges. We compared approaches relying on pre-trained resources with others that integrate insights from the social science literature.

        "Title": " Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation",
        "Abstract": " During phonation, the vocal folds exhibit a self-sustained oscillatory motion, which is influenced by the physical properties of the speaker\u2019s vocal folds and driven by the balance of bio-mechanical and aerodynamic forces across the glottis. Subtle changes in the speaker\u2019s physical state can affect voice production and alter these oscillatory patterns. Measuring these can be valuable in developing computational tools that analyze voice to infer the speaker\u2019s state. Traditionally, vocal fold oscillations (VFOs) are measured directly using physical devices in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows us to infer the VFOs directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis. The approach, called the ADLES-VFT algorithm, is proposed in the context of a joint model that combines a phonation model (with a glottal flow waveform as the output) and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model such that the output of the joint model is an estimated waveform. The ADLES-VFT algorithm is a forward-backward algorithm which minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of this joint model to estimate its parameters. Once estimated, these parameter values are used in conjunction with a phonation model to obtain its solutions. Since the parameters correlate with the physical properties of the vocal folds of the speaker, model solutions obtained using them represent the individualized VFOs for each speaker. The approach is flexible and can be applied to various phonation models. In addition to presenting the methodology, we show how the VFOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes. Mathematical derivations are provided in an appendix for better readability.",

        "Abstract": " Learning with reduced labeling standards, such as noisy label, partial label, and multiple label candidates, which we generically refer to as \\textit{imprecise} labels, is a commonplace challenge in machine learning tasks. Previous methods tend to propose specific designs for every emerging imprecise label configuration, which is usually unsustainable when multiple configurations of imprecision coexist. In this paper, we introduce imprecise label learning (ILL), a framework for the unification of learning with various imprecise label configurations. ILL leverages expectation-maximization (EM) for modeling the imprecise label information, treating the precise labels as latent variables.Instead of approximating the correct labels for training, it considers the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the imprecise information. We demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and, more importantly, a mixture of these settings. Notably, ILL surpasses the existing specified techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first unified framework with robust and effective performance across various challenging settings. We hope our work will inspire further research on this topic, unleashing the full potential of ILL in wider scenarios where precise labels are expensive and complicated to obtain.",

        "Abstract": " This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features. Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech -- phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to consonants, particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pronunciation, it is more predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning.",

These approaches have led to the development of versatile models capable of tackling a wide array of tasks, while delivering state-of-the-art performance. However, current models inherently lack the capacity to produce the requisite language for open-ended tasks, such as Audio Captioning or Audio Question&Answering. We introduce Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and text, and generates free-form text as output. The input audio is represented as a sequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder. A text encoder does the same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model. The unified architecture of Pengi enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions. When evaluated on 22 downstream tasks, our approach yields state-of-the-art performance in several of them. Our results show that connecting language models with audio models is a major step towards general-purpose audio understanding",

Without intervention, these social biases persist in the model's predictions in downstream tasks, leading to representational harm. Many strategies have been proposed to mitigate the effects of inappropriate social biases learned during pretraining. Simultaneously, methods for model compression have become increasingly popular to reduce the computational burden of LLMs. Despite the popularity and need for both approaches, little work has been done to explore the interplay between these two. We perform a carefully controlled study of the impact of model compression via quantization and knowledge distillation on measures of social bias in LLMs. Longer pretraining and larger models led to higher social bias, and quantization showed a regularizer effect with its best trade-off around 20% of the original pretraining time.",

Large model sizes makes computational cost one of the main limiting factors for training and evaluating such models; and has raised severe concerns about the sustainability, reproducibility, and inclusiveness for researching PLMs. These concerns are often based on personal experiences and observations. However, there had not been any large-scale surveys that investigate them. In this work, we provide a first attempt to quantify these concerns regarding three topics, namely, environmental impact, equity, and impact on peer reviewing. By conducting a survey with 312 participants from the NLP community, we capture existing (dis)parities between different and within groups with respect to seniority, academia, and industry; and their impact on the peer reviewing process. For each topic, we provide an analysis and devise recommendations to mitigate found disparities, some of which already successfully implemented.

Our exploration adopts a simple protocol that enforces constraints upon constraint-agnostic local models at testing time. With evaluations on three typical structured prediction tasks (named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and event argument extraction), we find that models trained with less data predict outputs with more structural violations in greedy decoding mode. Incorporating constraints provides consistent performance improvements and such benefits are larger in lower resource scenarios. Moreover, there are similar patterns with regard to the model sizes and more efficient models tend to enjoy more benefits. Finally, we also investigate settings with genre transfer and discover patterns that are related to domain discrepancies.",

        "Abstract": " Rising computational demands of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems have increased the barrier to entry for cutting-edge research while posing serious environmental concerns. Yet, progress on model efficiency has been impeded by practical challenges in model evaluation and comparison. For example, hardware is challenging to control due to disparate levels of accessibility across different institutions. Moreover, improvements in metrics such as FLOPs often fail to translate to progress in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Pentathlon, a benchmark for holistic and realistic evaluation of model efficiency. Pentathlon focuses on inference, which accounts for a majority of the compute in a model's lifecycle. It offers a strictly-controlled hardware platform, and is designed to mirror real-world applications scenarios. It incorporates a suite of metrics that target different aspects of efficiency, including latency, throughput, memory overhead, and energy consumption. Pentathlon also comes with a software library that can be seamlessly integrated into any codebase and enable evaluation. As a standardized and centralized evaluation platform, Pentathlon can drastically reduce the workload to make fair and reproducible efficiency comparisons. While initially focused on natural language processing (NLP) models, Pentathlon is designed to allow flexible extension to other fields. We envision Pentathlon will stimulate algorithmic innovations in building efficient models, and foster an increased awareness of the social and environmental implications in the development of future-generation NLP models.",

Analyzing bias in the text generated by an LLM using regard score shows measurable bias against queer people.

In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains.",

        "Abstract": " Self-training based on pseudo-labels has emerged as a dominant approach for addressing conditional distribution shifts in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation problems. A notable drawback, however, is that this family of approaches is susceptible to erroneous pseudo labels that arise from confirmation biases in the source domain and that manifest as nuisance factors in the target domain. A possible source for this mismatch is the reliance on only photometric cues provided by RGB image inputs, which may ultimately lead to sub-optimal adaptation. To mitigate the effect of mismatched pseudo-labels, we propose to incorporate structural cues from auxiliary modalities, such as depth, to regularise conventional self-training objectives. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive pixel-level objectness constraint that pulls the pixel representations within a region of an object instance closer, while pushing those from different object categories apart. To obtain object regions consistent with the true underlying object, we extract information from both depth maps and RGB-images in the form of multimodal clustering. Crucially, the objectness constraint is agnostic to the ground-truth semantic labels and, hence, appropriate for unsupervised domain adaptation. In this work, we show that our regularizer significantly improves top performing self-training methods (by up to $2$ points) in various UDA benchmarks for semantic segmentation. We include all code in the supplementary.",

Our approach leverages partial annotation, which reduces labeling costs for structured outputs by selecting only the most informative sub-structures for annotation. We also utilize self-training to incorporate the current model's automatic predictions as pseudo-labels for un-annotated sub-structures. A key challenge in effectively combining partial annotation with self-training to reduce annotation cost is determining which sub-structures to select to label. To address this challenge, we adopt an error estimator to adaptively decide the partial selection ratio according to the current model's capability. In evaluations spanning four structured prediction tasks, we show that our combination of partial annotation and self-training using an adaptive selection ratio reduces annotation cost over strong full annotation baselines under a fair comparison scheme that takes reading time into consideration.",

This limitation has motivated us to develop SYNTACC (Synthesizing speech with accents) which adapts conventional multi-speaker TTS to produce multi-accent speech. Our method uses the YourTTS model and involves a novel multi-accent training mechanism. The method works by decomposing each weight matrix into a shared component and an accent-dependent component, with the former being initialized by the pretrained multi-speaker TTS model and the latter being factorized into vectors using rank-1 matrices to reduce the number of training parameters per accent. This weight factorization method proves to be effective in fine-tuning the SYNTACC on multi-accent data sets in a low-resource condition. Our SYNTACC model eventually allows speech synthesis in not only different voices but also in different accents.",

We also use adapters to easily integrate incremental training data from data augmentation, and show that it matches the performance of re-training. We observe that cascaded systems are more easily adaptable towards specific target domains, due to their separate modules.

However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency.

These models employ a blockwise beam search with hypothesis reliability scoring to determine when to wait for more input speech before translating further. However, this method maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed -- this scheme cannot directly show a single \\textit{incremental} translation to users. Further, this method lacks mechanisms for \\textit{controlling} the quality vs. latency tradeoff. We propose a modified incremental blockwise beam search incorporating local agreement or hold-$n$ policies for quality-latency control.

        "Abstract": " The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches. In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components. Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the user.",

        "Abstract": " Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR\u2019s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN. We call it \"Adap\" because it allows for handling unseen PHP. The model performs only when necessary by providing a mechanism to narrow normalized regions and external query knowledge, reducing the runtime significantly.",

        "Abstract": " In many humanitarian scenarios, translation into severely low resource languages often does not require a universal translation engine, but a dedicated text-specific translation engine. For example, healthcare records, hygienic procedures, government communication, emergency procedures and religious texts are all limited texts. While generic translation engines for all languages do not exist, translation of multilingually known limited texts into new, endangered languages may be possible and reduce human translation effort. We attempt to leverage translation resources from rich resource languages to efficiently produce best possible translation quality for well known texts, which is available in multiple languages, in a new, severely low resource language. We examine two approaches 1.) best selection of seed sentences to jump start translations in a new language in view of best generalization to the remainder of a larger targeted text(s), and 2.) we adapt large general multilingual translation engines from many other languages to focus on a specific text in a new, unknown language. We find that adapting large pretrained multilingual models to the domain/text first and then to the severely low resource language works best. If we also select a best set of seed sentences, we can improve average chrF performance on new test languages from a baseline of 21.9 to 50.7, while reducing the number of seed sentences to only \u223c1,000 in the new, unknown language.",

This further harms the reproducibility of SSL, which is already limited to few research groups due to its resource usage. We show that more powerful techniques can actually lead to more efficient pre-training, opening SSL to more research groups. We propose WavLabLM, which extends WavLM\u2019s joint prediction and denoising to 40k hours of data across 136 languages. To build WavLabLM, we devise a novel multi-stage pre-training method, designed to address the language imbalance of multilingual data. WavLabLM achieves comparable performance to XLS-R on ML-SUPERB with less than $10 \\%$ of the training data, making SSL realizable with academic compute. We show that further efficiency can be achieved with a vanilla HuBERT Base model, which can maintain $94 \\%$ of XLS-R\u2019s performance with only $3 \\%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials.

Consequently, on-device processing plays a significant role in the practical implementation of SLU. This paper focuses on the end-to-end (E2E) SLU model due to its small latency property, unlike a cascade system, and aims to minimize the computational cost. We reduce the model size by applying tensor decomposition to the Conformer and E-Branchformer architectures used in our E2E SLU models. We propose to apply singular value decomposition to linear layers and the Tucker decomposition to convolution layers, respectively. We also compare COMP/PARFAC decomposition and Tensor-Train decomposition to the Tucker decomposition. Since the E2E model is represented by a single neural network, our tensor decomposition can flexibly control the number of parameters without changing feature dimensions. On the STOP dataset, we achieved 70.9% exact match accuracy under the tight constraint of only 15 million parameters.",

        "Abstract": " Collecting audio-text pairs is expensive; however, it is much easier to access text-only data. Unless using shallow fusion, end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models require architecture modifications or additional training schemes to use text-only data. Inspired by recent advances in decoder-only language models (LMs), such as GPT-3 and PaLM adopted for speech-processing tasks, we propose using a decoder-only architecture for ASR with simple text augmentation. To provide audio information, encoder features compressed by CTC prediction are used as prompts for the decoder, which can be regarded as refining CTC prediction using the decoder-only model. Because the decoder architecture is the same as an autoregressive LM, it is simple to enhance the model by leveraging external text data with LM training. An experimental comparison using LibriSpeech and Switchboard shows that our proposed models with text augmentation training reduced word error rates from ordinary CTC by 0.3% and 1.4% on LibriSpeech test-clean and testother set, respectively, and 2.9% and 5.0% on Switchboard and CallHome. The proposed model had advantage on computational efficiency compared with conventional encoder-decoder ASR models with a similar parameter setup, and outperformed them on the LibriSpeech 100h and Switchboard training scenarios.",

This paper presents multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB), covering 143 languages (ranging from high-resource to endangered), and considering both automatic speech recognition and language identification. Following the concept of SUPERB, ML-SUPERB utilizes frozen SSL features and employs a simple framework for multilingual tasks by learning a shallow downstream model. Similar to the SUPERB benchmark, we find speech SSL models can significantly improve performance compared to FBANK features. Furthermore, we find that multilingual models do not always perform better than their monolingual counterparts. We will release ML-SUPERB as a challenge with organized datasets and reproducible training scripts for future multilingual representation research.",

Model compression techniques such as pruning aim to reduce the model size and computation without degradation in accuracy. Prior studies focus on the pruning of Transformers; however, speech models not only utilize a stack of Transformer blocks, but also combine a frontend network based on multiple convolutional layers for low-level feature representation learning. This frontend has a small size but a heavy computational cost. In this work, we propose three task-specific structured pruning methods to deal with such heterogeneous networks. Experiments on LibriSpeech and SLURP show that the proposed method is more accurate than the original wav2vec2-base with 10% to 30% less computation, and is able to reduce the computation by 40% to 50% without any degradation.",

        "Abstract": " Causal inference is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. While the field of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing causal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality from empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause, which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more than 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through our experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causal inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to re-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models still fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference in in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Cause is a challenging task for LLMs, and would be helpful in guiding future research on improving LLMs' pure reasoning skills and generalizability.

TDT extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens and durations. During inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional Transducers which process the encoder output frame by frame. TDT models achieve both better accuracy and significantly faster inference than conventional Transducers on different sequence transduction tasks. TDT models for Speech Recognition achieve better accuracy and up to 2.82X faster inference than conventional Transducers. TDT models for Speech Translation achieve an absolute gain of over 1 BLEU on the MUST-C test compared with conventional Transducers, and its inference is 2.27X faster. In Speech Intent Classification and Slot Filling tasks, TDT models improve the intent accuracy by up to over 1% (absolute) over conventional Transducers, while running up to 1.28X faster. Our implementation of the TDT model will be open-sourced with the NeMo (https//github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit.",

        "Abstract": " Speech summarization requires processing several minute-long speech sequences to allow exploiting the whole context of a spoken document. A conventional approach is a cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text summarization (TS). However, the cascade systems are sensitive to ASR errors. Moreover, the cascade system cannot be optimized for input speech and utilize para-linguistic information. Recently, there has been an increased interest in end-to-end (E2E) approaches optimized to output summaries directly from speech. Such systems can thus mitigate the ASR errors of cascade approaches. However, E2E speech summarization requires massive computational resources because it needs to encode long speech sequences. We propose a speech summarization system that enables E2E summarization from 100 seconds, which is the limit of the conventional method, to up to 10 minutes (i.e., the duration of typical instructional videos on YouTube). However, the modeling capability of this model for minute-long speech sequences is weaker than the conventional approach. We thus exploit auxiliary text information from ASR transcriptions to improve the modeling capabilities. The resultant system consists of a dual speech/text encoder decoder-based summarization system. We perform experiments on the How2 dataset showing the proposed system improved METEOR scores by up to 2.7 points by fully exploiting the long spoken documents.",

        "Abstract": " In reverberant conditions with multiple concurrent speakers, each microphone acquires a mixture signal of multiple speakers at a different location. In over-determined conditions where the microphones out-number speakers, we can narrow down the solutions to speaker images and realize unsupervised speech separation by leveraging each mixture signal as a constraint (i.e., the estimated speaker images at a microphone should add up to the mixture). Equipped with this insight, we propose UNSSOR, an algorithm for $\\textbf{u}$nsupervised $\\textbf{n}$eural $\\textbf{s}$peech $\\textbf{s}$eparation by leveraging $\\textbf{o}$ver-determined training mixtu$\\textbf{r}$es. At each training step, we feed an input mixture to a deep neural network (DNN) to produce an intermediate estimate for each speaker, linearly filter the estimates, and optimize a loss so that, at each microphone, the filtered estimates of all the speakers can add up to the mixture to satisfy the above constraint. We show that this loss can promote unsupervised separation of speakers. The linear filters are computed in each sub-band based on the mixture and DNN estimates through the forward convolutive prediction (FCP) algorithm. To address the frequency permutation problem incurred by using sub-band FCP, a loss term based on minimizing intra-source magnitude scattering is proposed. Although UNSSOR requires over-determined training mixtures, we can train DNNs to achieve under-determined separation (e.g., unsupervised monaural speech separation). Evaluation results on two-speaker separation in reverberant conditions show the effectiveness and potential of UNSSOR.",

However, they often suffer from slow inference. This is primarily attributed to the incremental calculation of the decoder. This work proposes a partially AR framework, which employs segment-level vectorized beam search for improving the inference speed of an ASR model based on the hybrid connectionist temporal classification (CTC) attention-based architecture. It first generates an initial hypothesis using greedy CTC decoding, identifying low-confidence tokens based on their output probabilities. We then utilize the decoder to perform segment-level vectorized beam search on these tokens, re-predicting in parallel with minimal decoder calculations. Experimental results show that our method is 12 to 13 times faster in inference on the LibriSpeech corpus over AR decoding whilst preserving high accuracy.",

However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline.",

        "Abstract": " Transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition has achieved great success. However, the large footprint and computational overhead make it difficult to deploy these models in some real-world applications. Model compression techniques can reduce the model size and speed up inference, but the compressed model has a fixed architecture which might be suboptimal. We propose a novel Transformer encoder with Input-Dependent Dynamic Depth (I3D) to achieve strong performance-efficiency trade-offs. With a similar number of layers at inference time, I3D-based models outperform the vanilla Transformer and the static pruned model via iterative layer pruning. We also present interesting analysis on the gate probabilities and the input-dependency, which helps us better understand deep encoders.",

The diversity of human speech, however, often goes beyond the coverage of these corpora. We believe the ability to handle such diversity is crucial for AI systems to achieve human-level communication. Our work explores the use of more abundant real-world data for building speech synthesizers. We train TTS systems using real-world speech from YouTube and podcasts. We observe the mismatch between training and inference alignments in mel-spectrogram based autoregressive models, leading to unintelligible synthesis, and demonstrate that learned discrete codes within multiple code groups effectively resolves this issue. We introduce our MQTTS system whose architecture is designed for multiple code generation and monotonic alignment, along with the use of a clean silence prompt to improve synthesis quality. We conduct ablation analyses to identify the efficacy of our methods. We show that MQTTS outperforms existing TTS systems in several objective and subjective measures.",

To minimize the public health risk, it is important to monitor antiviral susceptibilities of influenza viruses. Analyses of the antiviral susceptibilities of influenza A and B viruses have been conducted globally; however, those of influenza C and D viruses are limited. Here, we determined the susceptibilities of influenza C viruses representing all six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) and influenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir and favipiravir) by using a focus reduction assay. All viruses tested were susceptible to both drugs. We then performed a genetic analysis to check for amino acid substitutions associated with baloxavir and favipiravir resistance and found that none of the viruses tested possessed these substitutions. Use of the focus reduction assay with the genotypic assay has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of influenza C and D viruses as well as influenza A and B viruses. Antiviral susceptibility monitoring of all influenza virus types should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses.",

We propose a learning objective that formalizes differences in perceptual quality, by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics. We identify temporal acoustic parameters \u2013 such as spectral tilt, spectral flux, shimmer, etc. \u2013 that are non-differentiable, and we develop a neural network estimator that can accurately predict their time-series values across an utterance. We also model phoneme-specific weights for each feature, as the acoustic parameters are known to show different behavior in different phonemes. We can add this criterion as an auxiliary loss to any model that produces speech, to optimize speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features. Experimentally we show that it improves speech enhancement workflows in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. We also provide an analysis of phoneme-dependent improvement on acoustic parameters, demonstrating the additional interpretability that our method provides. This analysis can suggest which features are currently the bottleneck for improvement.",

This work provides an insightful investigation of speech separation in reverberant and noisy-reverberant scenarios as an ASR front-end. In detail, we explore multi-channel separation methods, mask-based beamforming and complex spectral mapping, as well as the best features to use in the ASR back-end model. We employ the recent self-supervised learning representation (SSLR) as a feature and improve the recognition performance from the case with filterbank features. To further improve multi-speaker recognition performance, we present a carefully designed training strategy for integrating speech separation and recognition with SSLR. The proposed integration using TF-GridNet-based complex spectral mapping and WavLM-based SSLR achieves a 2.5% word error rate in reverberant WHAMR! test set, significantly outperforming an existing mask-based MVDR beamforming and filterbank integration (28.9%).",

However, existing studies in speech processing primarily focus on limited or specific tasks. Moreover, the lack of standardized benchmarks hinders a fair comparison across different approaches. Thus, we present Dynamic-SUPERB, a benchmark designed for building universal speech models capable of leveraging instruction tuning to perform multiple tasks in a zero-shot fashion. To achieve comprehensive coverage of diverse speech tasks and harness instruction tuning, we invite the community to collaborate and contribute, facilitating the dynamic growth of the benchmark. To initiate, Dynamic-SUPERB features 55 evaluation instances by combining 33 tasks and 22 datasets. This spans a broad spectrum of dimensions, providing a comprehensive platform for evaluation. Additionally, we propose several approaches to establish benchmark baselines. These include the utilization of speech models, text language models, and the multimodal encoder. Evaluation results indicate that while these baselines perform reasonably on seen tasks, they struggle with unseen ones. We also conducted an ablation study to assess the robustness and seek improvements in the performance. We release all materials to the public and welcome researchers to collaborate on the project, advancing technologies in the field together.",

The articulatory space is a promising inversion target, since this space captures the mechanics of speech production. To this end, we build an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model that leverages autoregression, adversarial training, and self supervision to generalize to unseen speakers. Our approach obtains 0.784 correlation on an electromagnetic articulography (EMA) dataset, improving the state-of-the-art by 12.5%. Additionally, we show the interpretability of these representations through directly com-paring the behavior of estimated representations with speech production behavior. Finally, we propose a resynthesis-based AAI evaluation metric that does not rely on articulatory labels, demonstrating its efficacy with an 18-speaker dataset.",

        "Abstract": " In this paper, we propose methods to build a powerful and efficient Image-to-Speech captioning (Im2Sp) model. To this end, we start with importing the rich knowledge related to image comprehension and language modeling from a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model into Im2Sp. We set the output of the proposed Im2Sp as discretized speech units, i.e., the quantized speech features of a self-supervised speech model. The speech units mainly contain linguistic information while suppressing other characteristics of speech. This allows us to incorporate the language modeling capability of the pre-trained vision-language model into the spoken language modeling of Im2Sp. With the vision-language pre-training strategy, we set new state-of-the-art Im2Sp performances on two widely used benchmark databases, COCO and Flickr8k. Then, we further improve the efficiency of the Im2Sp model. Similar to the speech unit case, we convert the original image into image units, which are derived through vector quantization of the raw image. With these image units, we can drastically reduce the required data storage for saving image data to just 0.8% when compared to the original image data in terms of bits.

        "Abstract": " It has been known that direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models usually suffer from the data scarcity issue because of the limited existing parallel materials for both source and target speech. Therefore to train a direct S2ST system, previous works usually utilize text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate samples in the target language by augmenting the data from speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, there is a limited investigation into how the synthesized target speech would affect the S2ST models. In this work, we analyze the effect of changing synthesized target speech for direct S2ST models. We find that simply combining the target speech from different TTS systems can potentially improve the S2ST performances. Following that, we also propose a multi-task framework that jointly optimizes the S2ST system with multiple targets from different TTS systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves consistent improvements (2.8 BLEU) over the baselines on the Fisher Spanish-English dataset.",

In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATs to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, we propose a novel data augmentation method that uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups (i.e., grammatical and compact combinations of two captions) which, together with the corresponding audio mixtures, increase not only the amount but also the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, we propose to employ nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm, which has not been explored in AAC research.

This paper proposes a method for zero-shot multilingual TTS using text-only data for the target language. The use of text-only data allows the development of TTS systems for low-resource languages for which only textual resources are available, making TTS accessible to thousands of languages. Inspired by the strong cross-lingual transferability of multilingual language models, our framework first performs masked language model pretraining with multilingual text-only data. Then we train this model with a paired data in a supervised manner, while freezing a language-aware embedding layer. This allows inference even for languages not included in the paired data but present in the text-only data. Evaluation results demonstrate highly intelligible zero-shot TTS with a character error rate of less than 12% for an unseen language.",

The model maintains an information highway to flow an over-complete input representation through multiple FSB-LSTM modules. Each FSB-LSTM module consists of a full-band block to model spectro-temporal patterns at all frequencies and a sub-band block to model patterns within each sub-band, where each of the two blocks takes a down-sampled representation as input and returns an up-sampled discriminative representation to be added to the block input via a residual connection. The model is designed to have a low algorithmic complexity, a small run-time buffer and a very low algorithmic latency, at the same time producing a strong enhancement performance on a noisy-reverberant speech enhancement task even if the hop size is as low as 2 ms.",

In this paper, we introduce our work on improving performance on FLEURS, a 102-language open ASR benchmark, by conditioning the entire model on language identity (LID). We investigate techniques inspired from recent Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) studies to help the model handle the large number of languages, conditioning on the LID predictions of auxiliary tasks.

While existing approaches have shown impressive performance in some common datasets, most of them are designed only for a single condition (e.g., single-channel, multi-channel, or a fixed sampling frequency) or only consider a single task (e.g., denoising or dereverberation). Currently, there is no universal SE approach that can effectively handle diverse input conditions with a single model. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate this line of research. First, we devise a single SE model that is independent of microphone channels, signal lengths, and sampling frequencies. Second, we design a universal SE benchmark by combining existing public corpora with multiple conditions. Our experiments on a wide range of datasets show that the proposed single model can successfully handle diverse conditions with strong performance.",

We also apply a retrieval-based approach, where model input is augmented with similar training samples. As a result, we achieved exact match (EM) accuracy 63.3/75.0 (average 69.15) for reminder/weather domain, and won the 1st place at the challenge.",

        "Abstract": " Recently there have been efforts to introduce new benchmark tasks for spoken language understanding (SLU), like semantic parsing. In this paper, we describe our proposed spoken semantic parsing system for the quality track (Track 1) in Spoken Language Understanding Grand Challenge which is part of ICASSP Signal Processing Grand Challenge 2023. We experiment with both end-to-end and pipeline systems for this task. Strong automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper and pretrained Language models (LM) like BART are utilized inside our SLU framework to boost performance. We also investigate the output level combination of various models to get an exact match accuracy of 80.8, which won the 1st place at the challenge.",

        "Abstract": " Speech signals, typically sampled at rates in the tens of thousands per second, contain redundancies, evoking inefficiencies in sequence modeling. High-dimensional speech features such as spectrograms are often used as the input for the subsequent model. However, they can still be redundant. Recent investigations proposed the use of discrete speech units derived from self-supervised learning representations, which significantly compresses the size of speech data. Applying various methods, such as de-duplication and subword modeling, can further compress the speech sequence length. Hence, training time is significantly reduced while retaining notable performance. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive and systematic exploration into the application of discrete units within end-to-end speech processing models. Experiments on 12 automatic speech recognition, 3 speech translation, and 1 spoken language understanding corpora demonstrate that discrete units achieve reasonably good results in almost all the settings. We intend to release our configurations and trained models to foster future research efforts.",

        "Title": " Joint Modelling of Spoken Language Understanding Tasks with Integrated Dialog History",
        "Abstract": " Most human interactions occur in the form of spoken conversations where the semantic meaning of a given utterance depends on the context. Each utterance in spoken conversation can be represented by many semantic and speaker attributes, and there has been an interest in building Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems for automatically predicting these attributes. Recent work has shown that incorporating dialogue history can help advance SLU performance. However, separate models are used for each SLU task, leading to an increase in inference time and computation cost. Motivated by this, we aim to ask can we jointly model all the SLU tasks while incorporating context to facilitate low-latency and lightweight inference? To answer this, we propose a novel model architecture that learns dialog context to jointly predict the intent, dialog act, speaker role, and emotion for the spoken utterance. Note that our joint prediction is based on an autoregressive model and we need to decide the prediction order of dialog attributes, which is not trivial. To mitigate the issue, we also propose an order agnostic training method. Our experiments show that our joint model achieves similar results to task-specific classifiers and can effectively integrate dialog context to further improve the SLU performance.1",

        "Abstract": " The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread acclaim for their remarkable emerging capabilities. However, the issue of hallucination has parallelly emerged as a by-product, posing significant concerns. While some recent endeavors have been made to identify and mitigate different types of hallucination, there has been a limited emphasis on the nuanced categorization of hallucination and associated mitigation methods. To address this gap, we offer a fine-grained discourse on profiling hallucination based on its degree, orientation, and category, along with offering strategies for alleviation. As such, we define two overarching orientations of hallucination (i) factual mirage (FM) and (ii) silver lining (SL). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, both orientations are further sub-categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic, with three degrees of severity - (i) mild, (ii) moderate, and (iii) alarming. We also meticulously categorize hallucination into six types (i) acronym ambiguity, (ii) numeric nuisance, (iii) generated golem, (iv) virtual voice, (v) geographic erratum, and (vi) time wrap. Furthermore, we curate HallucInation eLiciTation (HILT), a publicly available dataset comprising of 75,000 samples generated using 15 contemporary LLMs along with human annotations for the aforementioned categories. Finally, to establish a method for quantifying and to offer a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations, we propose Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI). We firmly believe that HVI holds significant value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in AI-related policy-making. In conclusion, we propose two solution strategies for mitigating hallucinations.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce target language context in E2E-ST, enhancing coherence and overcoming memory constraints of extended audio segments. Additionally, we propose context dropout to ensure robustness to the absence of context, and further improve performance by adding speaker information. Our proposed contextual E2E-ST outperforms the isolated utterance-based E2E-ST approach. Lastly, we demonstrate that in conversational speech, contextual information primarily contributes to capturing context style, as well as resolving anaphora and named entities.",

        "Abstract": " Previous Multimodal Information based Speech Processing (MISP) challenges mainly focused on audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) with commendable success. However, the most advanced back-end recognition systems often hit performance limits due to the complex acoustic environments. This has prompted a shift in focus towards the Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AVTSE) task for the MISP 2023 challenge in ICASSP 2024 Signal Processing Grand Challenges. Unlike existing audio-visual speech enhance-ment challenges primarily focused on simulation data, the MISP 2023 challenge uniquely explores how front-end speech processing, combined with visual clues, impacts back-end tasks in real-world scenarios. This pioneering effort aims to set the first benchmark for the AVTSE task, offering fresh insights into enhancing the ac-curacy of back-end speech recognition systems through AVTSE in challenging and real acoustic environments. This paper delivers a thorough overview of the task setting, dataset, and baseline system of the MISP 2023 challenge. It also includes an in-depth analysis of the challenges participants may encounter. The experimental results highlight the demanding nature of this task, and we look forward to the innovative solutions participants will bring forward.",

        "Abstract": " Pre-training speech models on large volumes of data has achieved remarkable success. OpenAI Whisper is a multilingual multitask model trained on 680k hours of supervised speech data. It generalizes well to various speech recognition and translation benchmarks even in a zero-shot setup. However, the full pipeline for developing such models (from data collection to training) is not publicly accessible, which makes it difficult for researchers to further improve its performance and address training-related issues such as efficiency, robustness, fairness, and bias. This work presents an Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM), which reproduces Whisperstyle training using an open-source toolkit and publicly available data. OWSM even supports more translation directions and can be more efficient to train. We will publicly release all scripts used for data preparation, training, inference, and scoring as well as pretrained models and training logs to promote open science. 11https//github.com/espnet/espnet",

We introduce the CHiME-7 distant ASR (DASR) task, within the 7th CHiME challenge. This task comprises joint ASR and diarization in far-field settings with multiple, and possibly heterogeneous, recording devices. Different from previous challenges, we evaluate systems on 3 diverse scenarios CHiME-6, DiPCo, and Mixer 6. The goal is for participants to devise a single system that can generalize across different array geometries and use cases with no a-priori information. Another departure from earlier CHiME iterations is that participants are allowed to use open-source pre-trained models and datasets. In this paper, we describe the challenge design, motivation, and fundamental research questions in detail. We also present the baseline system, which is fully array-topology agnostic and features multi-channel diarization, channel selection, guided source separation and a robust ASR model that leverages self-supervised speech representations (SSLR).",

        "Abstract": " Recent works in end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) have proposed multi-tasking methods with soft parameter sharing which leverage machine translation (MT) data via secondary encoders that map text inputs to an eventual cross-modal representation. In this work, we instead propose a ST/MT multi-tasking framework with hard parameter sharing in which all model parameters are shared cross-modally. Our method reduces the speech-text modality gap via a pre-processing stage which converts speech and text inputs into two discrete token sequences of similar length -- this allows models to indiscriminately process both modalities simply using a joint vocabulary. With experiments on MuST-C, we demonstrate that our multi-tasking framework improves attentional encoder-decoder, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), transducer, and joint CTC/attention models by an average of +0.5 BLEU without any external MT data. Further, we show that this framework incorporates external MT data, yielding +0.8 BLEU, and also improves transfer learning from pre-trained textual models, yielding +1.8 BLEU.",

        "Abstract": " This paper describes our submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2), which consists of target speech enhancement for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments with multiple interferers such as music and competing speakers. Our approach builds upon the powerful iterative neural/beamforming enhancement (iNeuBe) framework introduced in our recent work, and this paper extends it for target speaker extraction. We therefore name the proposed approach as iNeuBe-X, where the X stands for extraction. To address the challenges encountered in the CEC2 setting, we introduce four major novelties (1) we extend the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model, originally designed for monaural speaker separation, for multi-channel, causal speech enhancement, and large improvements are observed by replacing the TCNDenseNet used in iNeuBe with this new architecture; (2) we leverage a recent dual window size approach with future-frame prediction to ensure that iNueBe-X satisfies the 5 ms constraint on algorithmic latency required by CEC2; (3) we introduce a novel speaker-conditioning branch for TF-GridNet to achieve target speaker extraction; (4) we propose a fine-tuning step, where we compute an additional loss with respect to the target speaker signal compensated with the listener audiogram. Without using external data, on the official development set our best model reaches a hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) score of 0.942 and a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SI-SDRi) of 18.8 dB. These results are promising given the fact that the CEC2 data is extremely challenging (e.g., on the development set the mixture SI-SDR is -12.3 dB). A demo of our submitted system is available at WAVLab CEC2 demo.",

        "Abstract": " Unsupervised topic clustering of spoken audio is an important research topic for zero-resourced unwritten languages. A classical approach is to find a set of spoken terms from only the audio based on dynamic time warping or generative modeling (e.g., hidden Markov model), and apply a topic model to classify topics. The spoken term discovery is the most important and difficult part. In this paper, we propose to combine self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) methods as a component of spoken term discovery and probabilistic topic models. Most SSRL methods pre-train a model which predicts high-quality pseudo labels generated from an audio-only corpus. These pseudo labels can be used to produce a sequence of pseudo subwords by applying deduplication and a subword model. Then, we apply a topic model based on latent Dirichlet allocation for these pseudo-subword sequences in an unsupervised manner. The clustering performance is evaluated on the Fisher corpus using normalized mutual information. We confirm the improvement of the proposed method and its effectiveness compared to an existing approach using dynamic time warping and topic models although the experimental setups are not directly comparable.",

We propose an objective for perceptual quality based on temporal acoustic parameters. These are fundamental speech features that play an essential role in various applications, including speaker recognition and paralinguistic analysis. We provide a differentiable estimator for four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors involving frequency-related parameters, energy or amplitude-related parameters, spectral balance parameters, and temporal features. Un-like prior work that looks at aggregated acoustic parameters or a few categories of acoustic parameters, our temporal acoustic parameter (TAP) loss enables auxiliary optimization and improvement of many fine-grained speech characteristics in enhancement workflows. We show that adding TAPLoss as an auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved perceptual quality and intelligibility. We use data from the Deep Noise Suppression 2020 Challenge to demonstrate that both time-domain models and time-frequency domain models can benefit from our method.",

Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.",

In the wake of this transition, a number of all-neural ASR architectures have been introduced. These so-called end-to-end (E2E) models provide highly integrated, completely neural ASR models, which rely strongly on general machine learning knowledge, learn more consistently from data, with lower dependence on ASR domain-specific experience. The success and enthusiastic adoption of deep learning, accompanied by more generic model architectures has led to E2E models now becoming the prominent ASR approach. The goal of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of E2E ASR models and corresponding improvements, and to discuss their properties and their relationship to classical hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR architectures. All relevant aspects of E2E ASR are covered in this work modeling, training, decoding, and external language model integration, discussions of performance and deployment opportunities, as well as an outlook into potential future developments.",

Inspired by recent success of task-specific structured pruning, we propose DPHuBERT, a novel task-agnostic compression method for speech SSL based on joint distillation and pruning. Experiments on SUPERB show that DPHuBERT outperforms pure distillation methods in almost all tasks. Moreover, DPHuBERT requires little training time and performs well with limited training data, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications. Our method can also be applied to various speech SSL models. Our code and models will be publicly available.",

        "Abstract": " Introduction External Quality Assessment (EQA) schemes are designed to provide a snapshot of laboratory proficiency, identifying issues and providing feedback to improve laboratory performance and inter-laboratory agreement in testing. Currently there are no international EQA schemes for seasonal influenza serology testing. Here we present a feasibility study for conducting an EQA scheme for influenza serology methods. Methods We invited participant laboratories from industry, contract research organizations (CROs), academia and public health institutions who regularly conduct hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) assays and have an interest in serology standardization. In total 16 laboratories returned data including 19 data sets for HAI assays and 9 data sets for MN assays. Results Within run analysis demonstrated good laboratory performance for HAI, with intrinsically higher levels of intra-assay variation for MN assays. Between run analysis showed laboratory and strain specific issues, particularly with B strains for HAI, whilst MN testing was consistently good across labs and strains. Inter-laboratory variability was higher for MN assays than HAI, however both assays showed a significant reduction in inter-laboratory variation when a human sera pool is used as a standard for normalization. Discussion This study has received positive feedback from participants, highlighting the benefit such an EQA scheme would have on improving laboratory performance, reducing inter laboratory variation and raising awareness of both harmonized protocol use and the benefit of biological standards for seasonal influenza serology testing.",

        "Abstract": " In this work we detail our submission to the Clarity ICASSP 2023 grand challenge, in which participants have to develop a strong target speech enhancement system for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments. Our system builds on our previous submission at the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2) iNeuBe-X, which consists in an iterative neural/conventional beamforming enhancement pipeline, guided by an enrollment utterance from the target speaker. This model, which won by a large margin the CEC2, is an extension of the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model for multi-channel, streamable target-speaker speech enhancement. Here, this approach is extended and further improved by leveraging generative adversarial training, which we show proves especially useful when the training data is limited. Using only the official 6k training scenes data, our best model achieves 0.80 hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) and 0.41 hearing-aid speech quality index (HASQI) scores on the synthetic evaluation set. However, our model generalized poorly on the semi-real evaluation set. This highlights the fact that our community should focus more on real-world evaluation and less on fully synthetic datasets.",

To this end, we propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark that enables general-purpose evaluation of unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering 5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. We evaluate 5 recent self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all tasks, emphasizing the need for future study on improving universal model performance. In addition, we show that representations may be improved with intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet serves as a strong intermediate task. We release our benchmark with evaluation code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in audio-visual learning.",

        "Abstract": " Most of the speech translation models heavily rely on parallel data, which is hard to collect especially for low-resource languages. To tackle this issue, we propose to build a cascaded speech translation system without leveraging any kind of paired data. We use fully unpaired data to train our unsupervised systems and evaluate our results on CoVoST 2 and CVSS. The results show that our work is comparable with some other early supervised methods in some language pairs. While cascaded systems always suffer from severe error propagation problems, we proposed denoising back-translation (DBT), a novel approach to building robust unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT). DBT successfully increases the BLEU score by 0.7--0.9 in all three translation directions. Moreover, we simplified the pipeline of our cascaded system to reduce inference latency and conducted a comprehensive analysis of every part of our work. We also demonstrate our unsupervised speech translation results on the established website.",

While recent advances have enabled intelligible articulatory synthesis using electromagnetic articulography (EMA), these methods lack critical articulatory information like excitation and nasality, limiting generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose an alternative MRI-based feature set that covers a much more extensive articulatory space than EMA. We also introduce normalization and denoising procedures to enhance the generalizability of deep learning methods trained on MRI data. Moreover, we propose an MRI-to-speech model that improves both computational efficiency and speech fidelity. Finally, through a series of ablations, we show that the proposed MRI representation is more comprehensive than EMA and identify the most suitable MRI feature subset for articulatory synthesis.",

To address data scarcity, this paper introduces Speech Collage, a method that synthesizes CS data from monolingual corpora by splicing audio segments. We further improve the smoothness quality of audio generation using an overlap-add approach. We investigate the impact of generated data on speech recognition in two scenarios using in-domain CS text and a zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text. Empirical results highlight up to 34.4% and 16.2% relative reductions in Mixed-Error Rate and Word-Error Rate for in-domain and zero-shot scenarios, respectively. Lastly, we demonstrate that CS augmentation bolsters the model's code-switching inclination and reduces its monolingual bias.",

In this paper, we discuss approaches to measuring model factual beliefs, updating incorrect factual beliefs in models, and visualizing graphical relationships between factual beliefs. Our main contributions include (1) new metrics for evaluating belief-updating methods focusing on the logical consistency of beliefs, (2) a training objective for Sequential, Local, and Generalizing updates (SLAG) that improves the performance of existing hypernetwork approaches, and (3) the introduction of the belief graph, a new form of visualization for language models that shows relationships between stored model beliefs. Our experiments suggest that models show only limited consistency between factual beliefs, but update methods can both fix incorrect model beliefs and greatly improve their consistency. Although off-the-shelf optimizers are surprisingly strong belief-updating baselines, our learned optimizers can outperform them in more difficult settings than have been considered in past work.",

However, we argue that its fixed 20ms resolution for hidden representations would not be optimal for various speech-processing tasks since their attributes (e.g., speaker characteristics and semantics) are based on different time scales. To address this limitation, we propose utilizing HuBERT representations at multiple resolutions for downstream tasks. We explore two approaches, namely the parallel and hierarchical approaches, for integrating HuBERT features with different resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that HuBERT with multiple resolutions outperforms the original model. This highlights the potential of utilizing multiple resolutions in SSL models like HuBERT to capture diverse information from speech signals.",

However, prior methods often struggle with a vocabulary mismatch between pretrained models, and LM cannot be directly utilized as they diverge from its NLU formulation. In this study, we propose a three-pass end-to-end (E2E) SLU system that effectively integrates ASR and LM subnetworks into the SLU formulation for sequence generation tasks. In the first pass, our architecture predicts ASR transcripts using the ASR subnetwork. This is followed by the LM subnetwork, which makes an initial SLU prediction. Finally, in the third pass, the deliberation subnetwork conditions on representations from the ASR and LM subnetworks to make the final prediction. Our proposed three-pass SLU system shows improved performance over cascaded and E2E SLU models on two benchmark SLU datasets, SLURP and SLUE, especially on acoustically challenging utterances.",

However, the resources needed to train these models has become prohibitively large as they continue to scale. Currently, only a few groups with substantial resources are capable of creating SSL models, which harms reproducibility. In this work, we optimize HuBERT SSL to fit in academic constraints. We reproduce HuBERT independently from the original implementation, with no performance loss. Our code and training optimizations make SSL feasible with only 8 GPUs, instead of the 32 used in the original work. We also explore a semi-supervised route, using an ASR model to skip the first pre-training iteration. Within one iteration of pre-training, our models improve over HuBERT on several tasks. Furthermore, our HuBERT Large variant requires only 8 GPUs, achieving similar performance to the original trained on 128.

However, searching the appropriate layers to insert adapters on large models has become difficult due to the large number of possible layers and thus a vast search space (2N possibilities for N layers). In this paper, we propose a technique that achieves automatic insertion of adapters for downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks. Our approach is based on two-stage training. First, we train our model for a specific downstream task with additional shallow learnable layers and weight parameters to obtain the weighted summation over the output of each layer in SSL. This training method is established by the SUPERB baseline [1]. This first-stage training determines the most important layers given their respective weights. In the second stage, we proceed to insert adapters to the most important layers, retaining both performance and neural architecture search efficiency. On the CommonVoice dataset[2] we obtain 20.6% absolute improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) on the Welsh language against the conventional method, which inserts the adapter modules into the highest layers without search. In the SLURP SLU task, our method yields 4.0% intent accuracy improvement against the same conventional baseline.",

While most methods employ the output of intermediate layers of the SSL model as real-valued features for downstream tasks, there is potential in exploring alternative approaches that use discretized token sequences. This approach offers benefits such as lower storage requirements and the ability to apply techniques from natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new protocol that utilizes discretized token sequences in ASR tasks, which includes de-duplication and sub-word modeling to enhance the input sequence. It reduces computational cost by decreasing the length of the sequence. Our experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that our proposed protocol performs competitively with conventional ASR systems using continuous input features, while reducing computational and storage costs.",

Conversely, label-based attention encoder-decoder mitigates this issue using soft attention to the input, while it tends to overestimate labels biased towards its training domain, unlike CTC. We exploit these complementary attributes and propose to integrate the frame- and label-synchronous (F-/L-Sync) decoding alternately performed within a single beam-search scheme. F-Sync decoding leads the decoding for block-wise processing, while L-Sync decoding provides the prioritized hypotheses using look-ahead future frames within a block. We maintain the hypotheses from both decoding methods to perform effective pruning. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed search algorithm achieves lower error rates compared to the other search methods, while being robust against out-of-domain situations.",

These models employ a blockwise beam search with hypothesis reliability scoring to determine when to wait for more input speech before translating further. However, this method maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed -- this scheme cannot directly show a single \\textit{incremental} translation to users. Further, this method lacks mechanisms for \\textit{controlling} the quality vs. latency tradeoff. We propose a modified incremental blockwise beam search incorporating local agreement or hold-$n$ policies for quality-latency control. We apply our framework to models trained for online or offline translation and demonstrate that both types can be effectively used in online mode. Experimental results on MuST-C show 0.6-3.6 BLEU improvement without changing latency or 0.8-1.4 s latency improvement without changing quality.",

The path with the highest posterior is commonly defined as the predicted alignment between the speech and the transcription. While the vanilla transducer does not have a prior preference for any of the valid paths, this work intends to enforce the preferred paths and achieve controllable alignment prediction. Specifically, this work proposes Bayes Risk Transducer (BRT), which uses a Bayes risk function to set lower risk values to the preferred paths so that the predicted alignment is more likely to satisfy specific desired properties. We further demonstrate that these predicted alignments with intentionally designed properties can provide practical advantages over the vanilla transducer. Experimentally, the proposed BRT saves inference cost by up to 46% for non-streaming ASR and reduces overall system latency by 41% for streaming ASR.",

        "Abstract": " Across a variety of ranking tasks, researchers use reciprocal rank to measure the effectiveness for users interested in exactly one relevant item. Despite its widespread use, evidence suggests that reciprocal rank is brittle when discriminating between systems. This brittleness, in turn, is compounded in modern evaluation settings where current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. We address the lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank by introducing and connecting it to the concept of best-case retrieval, an evaluation method focusing on assessing the quality of a ranking for the most satisfied possible user across possible recall requirements. This perspective allows us to generalize reciprocal rank and define a new preference-based evaluation we call lexicographic precision or lexiprecision. By mathematical construction, we ensure that lexiprecision preserves differences detected by reciprocal rank, while empirically improving sensitivity and robustness across a broad set of retrieval and recommendation tasks.",

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance.

        "Abstract": " While extreme-scale language models have demonstrated exceptional performance on a variety of language tasks, the degree of control over these language models through pure prompting can often be limited. Directly fine-tuning such language models can be effective for tailoring them, but it can be either extremely costly (e.g., GPT-3) or not even feasible for the broader community (e.g., GPT-4). We propose Inference-time Policy Adapters (IPA), which efficiently tailors a language model such as GPT-3 without fine-tuning it. IPA guides a large base model during decoding time through a lightweight policy adapter trained to optimize an arbitrary user objective with reinforcement learning. On five challenging text generation tasks, such as toxicity reduction and lexically constrained generation, IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language models. It outperforms competitive baseline methods, sometimes even including expensive fine-tuning. In particular, tailoring GPT-2 with IPA can outperform GPT-3, while tailoring GPT-3 with IPA brings a major performance boost over GPT-3 (and sometimes even over GPT-4). Our promising results highlight the potential of IPA as a lightweight alternative to tailoring extreme-scale language models.",

        "Title": " Identification of Nonlinear Latent Hierarchical Models",
        "Abstract": " Identifying latent variables and causal structures from observational data is essential to many real-world applications involving biological data, medical data, and unstructured data such as images and languages. However, this task can be highly challenging, especially when observed variables are generated by causally related latent variables and the relationships are nonlinear. In this work, we investigate the identification problem for nonlinear latent hierarchical causal models in which observed variables are generated by a set of causally related latent variables, and some latent variables may not have observed children. We show that the identifiability of causal structures and latent variables (up to invertible transformations) can be achieved under mild assumptions on causal structures, we allow for multiple paths between any pair of variables in the graph, which relaxes latent tree assumptions in prior work; on structural functions, we permit general nonlinearity and multi-dimensional continuous variables, alleviating existing work's parametric assumptions. Specifically, we first develop an identification criterion in the form of novel identifiability guarantees for an elementary latent variable model. Leveraging this criterion, we show that both causal structures and latent variables of the hierarchical model can be identified asymptotically by explicitly constructing an estimation procedure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish identifiability guarantees for both causal structures and latent variables in nonlinear latent hierarchical models.",

        "Abstract": " 3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which highfidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs. The first is sampling-invariant content transformation that makes the transformation invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly ensures multi-view consistency. The second is deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps which is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but greatly reduces memory footprint without degrading multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.

To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna.

Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking. In this work, we formally characterize and justify existing empirical in-sights and provide theoretical guarantees of MAE. We formulate the underlying data-generating process as a hierarchical latent variable model, and show that under reasonable assumptions, MAE provably identifies a set of latent variables in the hierarchical model, explaining why MAE can extract high-level information from pixels. Further, we show how key hyperparameters in MAE (the masking ratio and the patch size) determine which true latent variables to be recovered, therefore influencing the level of semantic information in the representation. Specifically, extremely large or small masking ratios inevitably lead to low-level representations. Our theory offers coherent explanations of existing empirical observations and provides insights for potential empirical improvements and fundamental limitations of the masked-reconstruction paradigm.

This makes the system vulnerable to malicious attacks when dealing with dishonest clients. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a secure and reliable FL system based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Our system incorporates a peer-to-peer voting mechanism and a reward-and-slash mechanism, which are powered by on-chain smart contracts, to detect and deter malicious behaviors. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that our framework is robust against malicious client-side behaviors.",

We propose DSR-LM, a Differentiable Symbolic Reasoning framework where pre-trained LMs govern the perception of factual knowledge, and a symbolic module performs deductive reasoning. In contrast to works that rely on hand-crafted logic rules, our differentiable symbolic reasoning framework efficiently learns weighted rules and applies semantic loss to further improve LMs. DSR-LM is scalable, interpretable, and allows easy integration of prior knowledge, thereby supporting extensive symbolic programming to robustly derive a logical conclusion. The results of our experiments suggest that DSR-LM improves the logical reasoning abilities of pre-trained language models, resulting in a significant increase in accuracy of over 20% on deductive reasoning benchmarks.

        "Abstract": " As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.",

The second is correlated generative KD that improves the generation diversity by distilling and preserving the diverse image-text correlation within the pre-trained models. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that KD-DLGAN achieves superior image generation with limited training data.

However, how to learn a universal 3D semantic segmentation (3DSS) model is largely neglected as most existing benchmarks are dominated by point clouds captured under normal weather. We introduce SemanticSTF, an adverse-weather point cloud dataset that provides dense point-level annotations and allows to study 3DSS under various adverse weather conditions. We study all-weather 3DSS modeling under two setups 1) domain adaptive 3DSS that adapts from normal-weather data to adverse-weather data; 2) domain generalizable 3DSS that learns all-weather 3DSS models from normal-weather data. Our studies reveal the challenge while existing 3DSS methods encounter adverse-weather data, showing the great value of SemanticSTF in steering the future endeavor along this very meaningful research direction. In addition, we design a domain randomization technique that alternatively randomizes the geometry styles of point clouds and aggregates their embeddings, ultimately leading to a generalizable model that can improve 3DSS under various adverse weather effectively.

However, low-rank model training necessitates adjusting several additional factorization hyperparameters, such as the rank of the factorization at each layer. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing Cuttlefish, an automated low-rank training approach that eliminates the need for tuning factorization hyperparameters. Cuttlefish leverages the observation that after a few epochs of full-rank training, the stable rank (i.e., an approximation of the true rank) of each layer stabilizes at a constant value. Cuttlefish switches from full-rank to low-rank training once the stable ranks of all layers have converged, setting the dimension of each factorization to its corresponding stable rank. Our results show that Cuttlefish generates models up to 5.6 times smaller than full-rank models, and attains up to a 1.2 times faster end-to-end training process while preserving comparable accuracy. Moreover, Cuttlefish outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank model training methods and other prominent baselines.

One way to improve training speed is to compress the message size in communication. Previous approaches have primarily focused on compressing gradients in a data parallelism setting, but compression in a model-parallel setting is an understudied area. We have discovered that model parallelism has fundamentally different characteristics than data parallelism. In this work, we present the first empirical study on the effectiveness of compression methods for model parallelism. We implement and evaluate three common classes of compression algorithms - pruning-based, learning-based, and quantization-based - using a popular Transformer training framework. We evaluate these methods across more than 160 settings and 8 popular datasets, taking into account different hyperparameters, hardware, and both fine-tuning and pre-training stages. We also provide analysis when the model is scaled up. Finally, we provide insights for future development of model parallelism compression algorithms.",

A recent alternative formulation instead treats federated learning as a distributed inference problem, where the goal is to infer a global posterior from partitioned client data (Al-Shedivat et al., 2021). This paper extends the inference view and describes a variational inference formulation of federated learning where the goal is to find a global variational posterior that well-approximates the true posterior. This naturally motivates an expectation propagation approach to federated learning (FedEP), where approximations to the global posterior are iteratively refined through probabilistic message-passing between the central server and the clients. We conduct an extensive empirical study across various algorithmic considerations and describe practical strategies for scaling up expectation propagation to the modern federated setting. We apply FedEP on standard federated learning benchmarks and find that it outperforms strong baselines in terms of both convergence speed and accuracy.",

        "Abstract": " Federated learning is a promising paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing the local data. However, the presence of heterogeneous devices in federated learning, such as mobile phones and IoT devices with varying memory capabilities, would limit the scale and hence the performance of the model could be trained. The mainstream approaches to address memory limitations focus on width-slimming techniques, where different clients train subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then the server aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from these methods suffers from performance degradation due to the negative impact of the actions taken to handle the varying subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase. In this paper, we introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in FL called FeDepth, which adaptively decomposes the full model into blocks according to the memory budgets of each client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain a full inference model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 5% and more than 10% improvements in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-wise fine-tuning on ViT.

        "Abstract": " Weight decay is a standard technique to improve generalization performance in modern deep neural network optimization, and is also widely adopted in federated learning (FL) to prevent overfitting in local clients. In this paper, we first explore the choices of weight decay and identify that weight decay value appreciably influences the convergence of existing FL algorithms. While preventing overfitting is crucial, weight decay can introduce a different optimization goal towards the global objective, which is further amplified in FL due to multiple local updates and heterogeneous data distribution. To address this challenge, we develop {\\it Federated optimization with Normalized Annealing Regularization} (FedNAR), a simple yet effective and versatile algorithmic plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing FL algorithms. Essentially, we regulate the magnitude of each update by performing co-clipping of the gradient and weight decay. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedNAR's convergence rate and conduct extensive experiments on both vision and language datasets with different backbone federated optimization algorithms. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate that incorporating FedNAR into existing FL algorithms leads to accelerated convergence and heightened model accuracy. Moreover, FedNAR exhibits resilience in the face of various hyperparameter configurations. Specifically, FedNAR has the ability to self-adjust the weight decay when the initial specification is not optimal, while the accuracy of traditional FL algorithms would markedly decline.

        "Title": " LightSeq Sequence Level Parallelism for Distributed Training of Long Context Transformers",
        "Abstract": " Increasing the context length of large language models (LLMs) unlocks fundamentally new capabilities, but also significantly increases the memory footprints of training. Previous model-parallel systems such as Megatron-LM partition and compute different attention heads in parallel, resulting in large communication volumes, so they cannot scale beyond the number of attention heads, thereby hindering its adoption. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, LightSeq, for long-context LLMs training. LightSeq has many notable advantages. First, LightSeq partitions over the sequence dimension, hence is agnostic to model architectures and readily applicable for models with varying numbers of attention heads, such as Multi-Head, Multi-Query and Grouped-Query attention. Second, LightSeq not only requires up to 4.7x less communication than Megatron-LM on popular LLMs but also overlaps the communication with computation. To further reduce the training time, LightSeq features a novel gradient checkpointing scheme to bypass an forward computation for memory-efficient attention. We evaluate LightSeq on Llama-7B and its variants with sequence lengths from 32K to 512K. Through comprehensive experiments on single and cross-node training, we show that LightSeq achieves up to 1.24-2.01x end-to-end speedup, and a 2-8x longer sequence length on models with fewer heads, compared to Megatron-LM.

In this paper, we introduce LMSYS-Chat-1M, a large-scale dataset containing one million real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs. This dataset is collected from 210K unique IP addresses in the wild on our Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website. We offer an overview of the dataset's content, including its curation process, basic statistics, and topic distribution, highlighting its diversity, originality, and scale. We demonstrate its versatility through four use cases developing content moderation models that perform similarly to GPT-4, building a safety benchmark, training instruction-following models that perform similarly to Vicuna, and creating challenging benchmark questions. We believe that this dataset will serve as a valuable resource for understanding and advancing LLM capabilities.

For example, particular demographics or attributes can be represented by the documents' topical content or authors. The 2021 Fair Ranking Track adopted a resource allocation task. The task focused on supporting Wikipedia editors who are looking to improve the encyclopedia's coverage of topics under the purview of a WikiProject. WikiProject coordinators and/or Wikipedia editors search for Wikipedia documents that are in need of editing to improve the quality of the article. The 2021 Fair Ranking track aimed to ensure that documents that are about, or somehow represent, certain protected characteristics receive a fair exposure to the Wikipedia editors, so that the documents have an fair opportunity of being improved and, therefore, be well-represented in Wikipedia. The under-representation of particular protected characteristics in Wikipedia can result in systematic biases that can have a negative human, social, and economic impact, particularly for disadvantaged or protected societal groups.",

        "Abstract": " This paper aims to understand the impacts of various data combinations (e.g., web text, wikipedia, github, books) on the training of large language models using SlimPajama. SlimPajama is a rigorously deduplicated, multi-source dataset, which has been refined and further deduplicated to 627B tokens from the extensive 1.2T tokens RedPajama dataset contributed by Together. We've termed our research as SlimPajama-DC, an empirical analysis designed to uncover fundamental characteristics and best practices associated with employing SlimPajama in the training of large language models. During our research with SlimPajama, two pivotal observations emerged (1) Global deduplication vs. local deduplication. We analyze and discuss how global (across different sources of datasets) and local (within the single source of dataset) deduplications affect the performance of trained models. (2) Proportions of high-quality/highly-deduplicated multi-source datasets in the combination. To study this, we construct six configurations of SlimPajama dataset and train individual ones using 1.3B Cerebras-GPT model with Alibi and SwiGLU. Our best configuration outperforms the 1.3B model trained on RedPajama using the same number of training tokens by a significant margin. All our 1.3B models are trained on Cerebras 16$\\times$ CS-2 cluster with a total of 80 PFLOP/s in bf16 mixed precision. We further extend our discoveries (such as increasing data diversity is crucial after global deduplication) on a 7B model with large batch-size training.

The emergence of Foundation Models made it easier to obtain expert models for a given task, but the heterogeneity of data that may be encountered at test time often means that any single expert is insufficient. We consider the Fusion of Experts (FoE) problem of fusing outputs of expert models with complementary knowledge of the data distribution and formulate it as an instance of supervised learning. Our method is applicable to both discriminative and generative tasks and leads to significant performance improvements in image and text classification, text summarization, multiple-choice QA, and automatic evaluation of generated text. We also extend our method to the\"frugal\"setting where it is desired to reduce the number of expert model evaluations at test time.",

In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains.",

        "Abstract": " Open-vocabulary segmentation of 3D scenes is a fundamental function of human perception and thus a crucial objective in computer vision research. However, this task is heavily impeded by the lack of large-scale and diverse 3D open-vocabulary segmentation datasets for training robust and generalizable models. Distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D open-vocabulary segmentation models helps but it compromises the open-vocabulary feature significantly as the 2D models are mostly finetuned with close-vocabulary datasets. We tackle the challenges in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation by exploiting the open-vocabulary multimodal knowledge and object reasoning capability of pre-trained foundation models CLIP and DINO, without necessitating any fine-tuning. Specifically, we distill open-vocabulary visual and textual knowledge from CLIP into a neural radiance field (NeRF) which effectively lifts 2D features into view-consistent 3D segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce the Relevancy-Distribution Alignment loss and Feature-Distribution Alignment loss to respectively mitigate the ambiguities of CLIP features and distill precise object boundaries from DINO features, eliminating the need for segmentation annotations during training. Extensive experiments show that our method even outperforms fully supervised models trained with segmentation annotations, suggesting that 3D open-vocabulary segmentation can be effectively learned from 2D images and text-image pairs.",

TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits of pretrained language models to recommendation systems.

        "Abstract": " Abstract In multitask retrieval, a single retriever is trained to retrieve relevant contexts for multiple tasks. Despite its practical appeal, naive multitask retrieval lags behind task-specific retrieval, in which a separate retriever is trained for each task. We show that it is possible to train a multitask retriever that outperforms task-specific retrievers by promoting task specialization. The main ingredients are (1) a better choice of pretrained model\u2014one that is explicitly optimized for multitasking\u2014along with compatible prompting, and (2) a novel adaptive learning method that encourages each parameter to specialize in a particular task. The resulting multitask retriever is highly performant on the KILT benchmark. Upon analysis, we find that the model indeed learns parameters that are more task-specialized compared to naive multitasking without prompting or adaptive learning.1",

To filter out uninformative anchors (such as \"homepage\" or other functional anchors), we present a novel filtering technique to only select anchors that contain similar types of information as search queries. Experiments show that Anchor-DR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unsupervised dense retrieval by a large margin (e.g., by 5.3% NDCG@10 on MSMARCO). The gain of our method is especially significant for search and question answering tasks. Our analysis further reveals that the pattern of anchor-document pairs is similar to that of search query-document pairs. Code available at https//github.com/Veronicium/AnchorDR.",

Prior works on retrieval augmentation usually jointly fine-tune the retriever and the LM, making them closely coupled. In this paper, we explore the scheme of generic retrieval plug-in the retriever is to assist target LMs that may not be known beforehand or are unable to be fine-tuned together. To retrieve useful documents for unseen target LMs, we propose augmentation-adapted retriever (AAR), which learns LM\u2019s preferences obtained from a known source LM.

        "Abstract": " We present Score, a rule engine designed and implemented for the Scone knowledge base system. Scone is a knowledge base system designed for storing and manipulating rich representations of general knowledge in symbolic form. It represents knowledge in the form of nodes and links in a network structure, and it can perform basic inference about the relationships between different elements efficiently. On its own, Scone acts as a sort of\"smart memory\"that can interface with other software systems. One area of improvement for Scone is how useful it can be in supplying knowledge to an intelligent agent that can use the knowledge to perform actions and update the knowledge base with its observations. We augment the Scone system with a production rule engine that automatically performs simple inference based on existing and newly-added structures in Scone's knowledge base, potentially improving the capabilities of any planning systems built on top of Scone. Production rule systems consist of\"if-then\"production rules that try to match their predicates to existing knowledge and fire their actions when their predicates are satisfied. We propose two kinds of production rules, if-added and if-needed rules, that differ in how they are checked and fired to cover multiple use cases. We then implement methods to efficiently check and fire these rules in a large knowledge base. The new rule engine is not meant to be a complex stand-alone planner, so we discuss how it fits into the context of Scone and future work on planning systems.",

We study various designs to pretrain T5 using an auxiliary model to construct more challenging token replacements for the main model to denoise. Key aspects under study include the decoding target, the location of the RTD head, and the masking pattern. Based on these studies, we develop a new model, METRO-T0, which is pretrained using the redesigned ELECTRA-Style pretraining strategies and then prompt-finetuned on a mixture of NLP tasks. METRO-T0 outperforms all similar-sized baselines on prompted NLP benchmarks, such as _T0 Eval_ and MMLU, and rivals the state-of-the-art T0-11B model with only **8%** of its parameters. Our analysis on model\u2019s neural activation and parameter sensitivity reveals that the effectiveness of METRO-T0 stems from more balanced contribution of parameters and better utilization of their capacity.

However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and its influence on prognosis. Methods The correlation between CD8+TILs and IC expression in AITL was analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 2), flow cytometry (n = 20), and RNA sequencing (n = 20). Biological changes related to CD8+TILs exhaustion at different cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (mean expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1) in AITL were evaluated using RNA sequencing (n = 20) and further validated using the GEO dataset (n = 51). The impact of CD8 protein expression and CTL levels on patient prognosis was analyzed using flow cytometry and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results Our findings demonstrated that the higher the infiltration of CD8+TILs, the higher was the proportion of exhausted CD8+TILs characterized by the overexpression of multiple IC. This was accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which suggested severe exhaustion in CD8+TILs and may be one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL. Conclusion Our study comprehensively reveals the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their potential negative impact on AITL prognosis, which facilitates further mechanistic studies and is valuable for guiding immunotherapy strategies.",

        "Abstract": " The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and verified against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5\u00b0 is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life.",

The results showed that a total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identified in the branch exudates and dried fruits of Schisandra. The components of germplasm resources with different fruit colors were significantly different. The ion mobility spectrum and OPLS-DA results showed that white and yellow fruits were more similar compared to red fruits. The volatile components in dried fruits were significantly higher than those in branch exudates. After VIP (variable importance in projection) screening, 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained. After screening by odor activity value (OAV), there were 24 volatile components greater than 1 in both dried fruits and branch exudates. The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and the most important contributing volatile substance in white fruit was (E)-2-hexenal.",

        "Abstract": " We propose a simple yet effective and robust method for contrastive captioning generating discriminative captions that distinguish target images from very similar alternative distractor images. Our approach is built on a pragmatic inference procedure that formulates captioning as a reference game between a speaker, which produces possible captions describing the target, and a listener, which selects the target given the caption. Unlike previous methods that derive both speaker and listener distributions from a single captioning model, we leverage an off-the-shelf CLIP model to parameterize the listener. Compared with captioner-only pragmatic models, our method benefits from rich vision language alignment representations from CLIP when reasoning over distractors. Like previous methods for discriminative captioning, our method uses a hyperparameter to control the tradeoff between the informativity (how likely captions are to allow a human listener to discriminate the target image) and the fluency of the captions. However, we find that our method is substantially more robust to the value of this hyperparameter than past methods, which allows us to automatically optimize the captions for informativity - outperforming past methods for discriminative captioning by 11% to 15% accuracy in human evaluations",

        "Abstract": " Innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) due to the increasing size of the aging population and the lack of effective drug treatment. Here, we report the therapeutic effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by microglia, including macrosomes and small EVs, on AD-associated pathology. Macrosomes strongly inhibited \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) aggregation and rescued cells from A\u03b2 misfolding\u2013induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, macrosome administration reduced A\u03b2 plaques and ameliorated cognitive impairment in mice with AD. In contrast, small EVs slightly promoted A\u03b2 aggregation and did not improve AD pathology. Proteomic analysis of small EVs and macrosomes revealed that macrosomes harbor several important neuroprotective proteins that inhibit A\u03b2 misfolding. In particular, the small integral membrane protein 10\u2013like protein 2B in macrosomes has been shown to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation. Our observations provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD over conventional ineffective drug treatments.",

This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions. We investigate two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively, and devise an effective inference schedule to enhance the solution quality. We evaluate our methods on two well-studied NPC combinatorial optimization problems Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS). Experimental results show that DIFUSCO strongly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers, improving the performance gap between ground-truth and neural solvers from 1.76% to 0.46% on TSP-500, from 2.46% to 1.17% on TSP-1000, and from 3.19% to 2.58% on TSP10000.

        "Abstract": " Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) is a promising paradigm to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning. It decomposes the source task into sub goal conditional subtasks and conducts exploration and exploitation in the subgoal space. The effectiveness of GCHRL heavily relies on sub goal representation functions and sub goal selection strategy. However, existing works often overlook the temporal coherence in GCHRL when learning latent sub goal representations and lack an efficient sub goal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. This paper proposes HIerarchical reinforcement learning via dynamically building Latent Landmark graphs (HILL) to overcome these limitations. HILL learns latent subgoal representations that satisfy temporal coherence using a contrastive representation learning objective. Based on these representations, HILL dynamically builds latent landmark graphs and employs a novelty measure on nodes and a utility measure on edges. Finally, HILL develops a subgoal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by jointly considering both measures. Experimental results demonstrate that HILL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on continuous control tasks with sparse rewards in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

        "Abstract": " Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the misalignment between two modalities can result in\"hallucination\", generating textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context. To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines.

        "Abstract": " To understand the secondary transfer performances of residual prestress after the anchoring failure of end-anchored steel wire strands due to corrosion fracture, six steel wire strand components of post-tensioning prestress were designed and fabricated. One-side fast corrosion was applied to the steel wire strand components using the electrochemical method until anchoring failure was reached. The sphere of influence, stress changes, and the retraction and swelling effect of broken beams after failure were investigated. The influences of factors such as concrete strength, stirrup area, and the length of the component on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress were discussed. Based on the deformation relationship between prestressed steel wire strands and concrete in the stress transfer zone, a stress equation was established and solved through a bond constitutive model. A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost. Moreover, the loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength. When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases significantly. Concrete strength has significant influences on the length of secondary transfer. The proposed simplified calculation method of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress has a relatively high accuracy, with an average error of 2.9% and a maximum error of 5.2%.",

        "Abstract": " Purpose To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity. Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval 1.071\u20138.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI 1.733\u20136.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.",

        "Abstract": " The waning of Moore's Law has shifted the focus of the tech industry towards alternative methods for continued performance gains. While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program's performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code.",

Specifically, GenCo applies GPT in two ways firstly, it generates multiple augmented texts for each input instance to enhance the semantic embedding of the instance and improve the mapping to relevant labels; secondly, it generates augmented texts conditioned on the predicted label during self-training, which makes the generative process tailored to the decision boundaries in the target space.

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance.

These include regular RPE techniques applied for nongeometric data, as well as novel RPEs operating on the sequences of tokens embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g. point clouds). FLTs construct the optimal RPE mechanism implicitly by learning its spectral representation. As opposed to other architectures combining efficient low-rank linear attention with RPEs, FLTs remain practical in terms of their memory usage and do not require additional assumptions about the structure of the RPE-mask. FLTs allow also for applying certain structural inductive bias techniques to specify masking strategies, e.g. they provide a way to learn the so-called local RPEs introduced in this paper and providing accuracy gains as compared with several other linear Transformers for language modeling. We also thoroughly tested FLTs on other data modalities and tasks, such as image classification and 3D molecular modeling. For 3D-data FLTs are, to the best of our knowledge, the first Transformers architectures providing RPE-enhanced linear attention.",

        "Abstract": " Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV) aims to detect the event timestamps described by the natural language query from untrimmed videos. This paper discusses the challenge of achieving efficient computation in TSGV models while maintaining high performance. Most existing approaches exquisitely design complex architectures to improve accuracy with extra layers and loss, suffering from inefficiency and heaviness. Although some works have noticed that, they only make an issue of feature fusion layers, which can hardly enjoy the highspeed merit in the whole clunky network. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel efficient multi-teacher model (EMTM) based on knowledge distillation to transfer diverse knowledge from both heterogeneous and isomorphic networks. Specifically, We first unify different outputs of the heterogeneous models into one single form. Next, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU) is built to acquire high-quality integrated soft labels from multiple teachers. After that, the KAU module leverages the multi-scale video and global query information to adaptively determine the weights of different teachers. A Shared Encoder strategy is then proposed to solve the problem that the student shallow layers hardly benefit from teachers, in which an isomorphic teacher is collaboratively trained with the student to align their hidden states. Extensive experimental results on three popular TSGV benchmarks demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient without bells and whistles.",

This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https//github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE.",

        "Abstract": " The task of knowledge graph completion (KGC) is of great importance. To achieve scalability when dealing with large-scale knowledge graphs, recent works formulate KGC as a sequence-to-sequence process, where the incomplete triplet (input) and the missing entity (output) are both verbalized as text sequences. However, inference with these methods relies solely on the model parameters for implicit reasoning and neglects the use of KG itself, which limits the performance since the model lacks the capacity to memorize a vast number of triplets. To tackle this issue, we introduce ReSKGC, a Retrieval-enhanced Seq2seq KGC model, which selects semantically relevant triplets from the KG and uses them as evidence to guide output generation with explicit reasoning. Our method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets Wikidata5M and WikiKG90Mv2, which contain about 5M and 90M entities, respectively.",

        "Abstract": " A popular approach for improving the correctness of output from large language models (LLMs) is Self-Consistency - poll the LLM multiple times and output the most frequent solution. Existing Self-Consistency techniques always generate a constant number of samples per question, where a better approach will be to non-uniformly distribute the available budget based on the amount of agreement in the samples generated so far. In response, we introduce Adaptive-Consistency, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique that dynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweight stopping criterion. Our experiments over 17 reasoning and code generation datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that Adaptive-Consistency reduces sample budget by up to 7.9 times with an average accuracy drop of less than 0.1%.

        "Abstract": " Recent AI-assistant agents, such as ChatGPT, predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our approach encompasses four stages first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable responses for each query directly without the principle set and the demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including<200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning). Dromedary significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets with various settings.",

The diffusion probability model is powerful to learn complicated multimodal distributions, which has shown promising and potential applications to RL. In this paper, we formally build a theoretical foundation of policy representation via the diffusion probability model and provide practical implementations of diffusion policy for online model-free RL. Concretely, we character diffusion policy as a stochastic process, which is a new approach to representing a policy. Then we present a convergence guarantee for diffusion policy, which provides a theory to understand the multimodality of diffusion policy. Furthermore, we propose the DIPO which is an implementation for model-free online RL with DIffusion POlicy. To the best of our knowledge, DIPO is the first algorithm to solve model-free online RL problems with the diffusion model. Finally, extensive empirical results show the effectiveness and superiority of DIPO on the standard continuous control Mujoco benchmark.",

Our model demonstrates a wide suite of multimodal capabilities image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. Ours is the first approach capable of conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image (and text) outputs. To achieve strong performance on image generation, we propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model. This mapping network translates hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling us to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. Our approach outperforms baseline generation models on tasks with longer and more complex language. In addition to novel image generation, our model is also capable of image retrieval from a prespecified dataset, and decides whether to retrieve or generate at inference time. This is done with a learnt decision module which conditions on the hidden representations of the LLM. Our model exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models. It can process image-and-text inputs, and produce retrieved images, generated images, and generated text -- outperforming non-LLM based generation models across several text-to-image tasks that measure context dependence.",

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.",

The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks.

The model uses a hierarchical transformer with intra-frame off-set attention and inter-frame self-attention. The attention mechanism allows the model to freely attend between any two vertex patches to learn nonlocal relationships in the spatial-temporal domain. Masked vertex modeling and future frame prediction are used as two self-supervised tasks to fully activate the bi-directional and auto-regressive attention in our hierarchical transformer.

However, publicly available data have been scarce for these tasks due to strict privacy constraints and high annotation costs. To make things worse, the non-overlapping entity spaces from different datasets hinder the knowledge transfer between document types. In this paper, we propose a method to collect massive-scale and weakly labeled data from the web to benefit the training of VDER models. The collected dataset, named DocumentNet, does not depend on specific document types or entity sets, making it universally applicable to all VDER tasks. The current DocumentNet consists of 30M documents spanning nearly 400 document types organized in a four-level ontology. Experiments on a set of broadly adopted VDER tasks show significant improvements when DocumentNet is incorporated into the pre-training for both classic and few-shot learning settings. With the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), DocumentNet provides a large data source to extend their multi-modal capabilities for VDER.",

In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.",

Despite this, pretraining data design is critically under-documented and often guided by empirically unsupported intuitions. To address this, we pretrain 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models, training on data curated (1) at different times, (2) with varying toxicity and quality filters, and (3) with different domain compositions. First, we quantify the effect of pretraining data age. A temporal shift between evaluation data and pretraining data leads to performance degradation, which is not overcome by finetuning. Second, we explore the effect of quality and toxicity filters, showing a trade-off between performance on standard benchmarks and risk of toxic generations. Our findings indicate there does not exist a one-size-fits-all solution to filtering training data. We also find that the effects of different types of filtering are not predictable from text domain characteristics. Lastly, we empirically validate that the inclusion of heterogeneous data sources, like books and web, is broadly beneficial and warrants greater prioritization. These findings constitute the largest set of experiments to validate, quantify, and expose many undocumented intuitions about text pretraining, which we hope will help support more informed data-centric decisions in LM development.",

However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study to what extent these models remain aligned, even when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs. However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models.",

However, a major challenge for this procedure becoming an accessible treatment option for patients is the lack of standard measures to document benefits to QOL. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures are well-suited for this kind of intervention, where the perspective of the patient is central to defining treatment success. To date, qualitative work with experts, clinicians, and patients has been used to identify the most important domains of QOL for PRO item development. Specifically, our group\u2019s qualitative work has identified several domains of QOL that are unique to individuals who have received upper extremity transplants, which are distinct from topics covered by existing PRO measures. These include emotional and social aspects of upper extremity transplant, such as Expectations and Perceived Outcomes, Integration and Assimilation of Transplant, Fitting in, and Post-Surgical Challenges and Complications. The broad topic of Satisfaction with Transplant was subdivided into three subtopics Function, Sensation, and Aesthetics. Satisfaction with Sensation was also identified as a unique domain not evaluated by existing PRO measures. This report operationalizes these eight QOL domains by presenting scoping definitions. This manuscript describes the work that has been completed for domain characterization as an early step toward developing standardized PRO measures to evaluate these important outcomes specific to upper extremity transplantation.",

        "Abstract": " In our submission to the SIGMORPHON 2023 Shared Task on interlinear glossing (IGT), we explore approaches to data augmentation and modeling across seven low-resource languages. For data augmentation, we explore two approaches creating artificial data from the provided training data and utilizing existing IGT resources in other languages. On the modeling side, we test an enhanced version of the provided token classification baseline as well as a pretrained multilingual seq2seq model. Additionally, we apply post-correction using a dictionary for Gitksan, the language with the smallest amount of data. We find that our token classification models are the best performing, with the highest word-level accuracy for Arapaho and highest morpheme-level accuracy for Gitksan out of all submissions. We also show that data augmentation is an effective strategy, though applying artificial data pretraining has very different effects across both models tested.",

Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools. Few represent non-concatentative processes like infixation, reduplication, mutation, truncation, and tonal overwriting in a consistent and formally rigorous way (on par with affixation). We propose an annotation convention\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGeneralized Glossing Guidelines (GGG) that combines all of these positive properties using an Item-and-Process (IP) framework.

        "Abstract": " Recent advances in large language models have prompted researchers to examine their abilities across a variety of linguistic tasks, but little has been done to investigate how models handle the interactions in meaning across words and larger syntactic forms\u2014i.e. phenomena at the intersection of syntax and semantics. We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions. We created a novel evaluation dataset by utilitizing the unique linguistic properties of a subset of optionally transitive English verbs. This dataset was used to prompt varying sizes of three model classes to see if they are sensitive to agentivity at the lexical level, and if they can appropriately employ these word-level priors given a specific syntactic context. Overall, GPT-3 text-davinci-003 performs extremely well across all experiments, outperforming all other models tested by far. In fact, the results are even better correlated with human judgements than both syntactic and semantic corpus statistics. This suggests that LMs may potentially serve as more useful tools for linguistic annotation, theory testing, and discovery than select corpora for certain tasks.",

        "Abstract": " Blocking all submodules (SMs) of the hybrid modular multilevel converter is a simple way to clear dc fault currents. However, each arm's reverse-biased voltage (RBV) is uncontrolled in this method. In this case, the dc fault current will concentrate into two of the six arms. Thus, the maximum arm current will increase to the fault current in the dc line, which will lead to arm overcurrent. Moreover, full-bridge submodules (FB-SMs) will be charged by the large arm currents and may suffer from severe overvoltage. The arm overcurrent and FB-SM overvoltage problems have not been solved properly. This letter proposes a method to control the RBV of each arm during the dc fault-clearing process to relieve the arm overcurrent and FB-SM overvoltage. Thus, the safety of the converter can be improved. In the meantime, the impact on the dc fault clearing time is well limited. Simulations and experiments validated the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": " The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and aerosol chemical composition were concurrently measured via a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne Time-of-Flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM), respectively, during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. During the observation period, the mean CCN number concentrations ranged from 1345 \u00b1 1270 cm\u22123 at SS = 0.1% to 3267 \u00b1 2325 cm\u22123 at SS = 0.3%. The mean critical activation diameters (D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 172 \u00b1 13 nm, 102 \u00b1 8 nm, and 84 \u00b1 7 nm, corresponding to the average hygroscopicity parameters (\u03baCCN) of 0.34, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively. The diurnal variations in D50 suggested that the local primary emissions significantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less influence on D50 at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources. As PM2.5 concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. At a specific SS, D50 decreased with increases in the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric aging was beneficial to CCN activation. In this study, the commonly used f44 (or OC) was weakly correlated with \u03baorg and failed to describe the variations in \u03baorg. Instead, the variations in \u03baorg can be well parameterized with the Org/BC ratio. The correlation between \u03ba derived from bulk chemical compositions and CCN measurements was substantially improved when this \u03baorg scheme was adopted, emphasizing the importance of considering \u03baorg variations on deriving \u03bachem from aerosol chemical composition.",

        "Abstract": " As an important mechanism in gas injection development, the diffusion characteristics of natural gas in tight reservoirs are important in the dynamic prediction of the development effect and optimization of injection-production parameters. In this paper, a high-pressure and high-temperature oil\u2013gas diffusion experimental device was built, which was used to study the effects of the porous medium, pressure, permeability, and fracture on oil\u2013gas diffusion under tight reservoir conditions. Two mathematical models were used to calculate the diffusion coefficients of natural gas in bulk oil and cores. Besides, the numerical simulation model was established to study the diffusion characteristics of natural gas in gas flooding and huff-n-puff, and five diffusion coefficients were selected based on experimental results for simulation study. The remaining oil saturation of grids, the recovery of single layers, and the distribution of CH4 mole fraction in oil were analyzed based on the simulation results. The experimental results show that the diffusion process can be divided into three stages the initial stage of instability, the diffusion stage, and the stable stage. The absence of medium, high pressure, high permeability, and the existence of fracture are beneficial to natural gas diffusion, which can also reduce the equilibrium time and increase the gas pressure drop. Furthermore, the existence of fracture is beneficial to the early diffusion of gas. The simulation results show that the diffusion coefficient has a greater influence on the oil recovery of huff-n-puff. For gas flooding and huff-n-puff, the diffusion features both perform such that a high diffusion coefficient results in a close diffusion distance, small sweep range, and low oil recovery. However, a high diffusion coefficient can achieve high oil washing efficiency near the injecting well. The study is helpful to provide theoretical guidance for natural gas injection in tight oil reservoirs.",

        "Abstract": " The aerosol optical property products of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis dataset have been extensively investigated on a global or regional scale. However, the understanding of MERRA-2 aerosol component products on an extensive temporal and spatial scale is inadequate. Recently, the aerosol component products have been derived from the observations of Polarization and Directionality of the Earth\u2019s Reflectances/Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Science coupled with observations from a Lidar (POLDER/PARASOL). This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dust and black carbon (BC) column concentration using independent satellite-based aerosol component concentration retrievals. Both GRASP/Component and MERRA-2 reanalysis products can capture well the temporal variation in dust column concentration over the dust emission resource and downwind dust-dominated regions with the correlation coefficient (R) varying from 0.80 to 0.98. MERRA-2 reanalysis dust products present higher column concentration than GRASP/Component dust retrievals with relative differences of about 20~70%, except in the Taklamakan Desert and Bay of Bengal, where the relative differences can be negative. The differences in dust column concentration over the African dust regions are larger than that over the Asian dust regions. Similar temporal variations in BC column concentration are characterized by both GRASP/Component BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products with R of about 0.70~0.90, except in the North China Plain region. We should pay more caution with the regional applicability of MERRA-2 component products when large differences and high correlation coefficients are obtained simultaneously. The results are favorable for identifying the behavior of MERRA-2 reanalysis component estimation in a new view and demonstrate a practical application of the satellite-based component retrievals, which could make more contributions to the improvement of model estimation in the near future.",

        "Abstract": " Seasonal and diurnal characteristics of the vertical profiles of aerosol properties are essential for detecting the regional transport and the climatic radiative effects of aerosol particles. We have studied the seasonal and diurnal characteristics of the vertical distribution of aerosols in urban Beijing from 2017 to 2021 based on long-term Raman\u2013Mie LiDAR observations. The influence of the vertical distribution of aerosols, the meteorological conditions within the boundary layer, the optical\u2013radiometric properties of aerosols, and their interconnections, were investigated during a heavy haze pollution event in Beijing from 8 to 15 February 2020 using both meteorological and sun photometer data. The aerosol extinction coefficient was highest in summer (0.4 km\u22121), followed by winter (0.35 km\u22121), and roughly equal in spring and autumn (0.3 km\u22121). The aerosol extinction coefficient showed clear daily variations and was different in different seasons as a result of the variation in the height of the boundary layer. During the haze pollution event, the particulate matter mainly consisted of scattered spherical fine particles and the accumulation time of pollutants measured via the AOD440nm and PM2.5 mass concentration was different as a result of the hygroscopic growth of the aerosol particles. This growth increased scattering and led to an increase in the aerosol optical depth. The vertical transport of particulate matter also contributed to the increase in the aerosol optical depth.",

In this paper, we systematically investigate the advantages and challenges of LLMs for MMT by answering two questions 1) How well do LLMs perform in translating massive languages? 2) Which factors affect LLMs' performance in translation? We thoroughly evaluate eight popular LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that translation capabilities of LLMs are continually improving. GPT-4 has beat the strong supervised baseline NLLB in 40.91% of translation directions but still faces a large gap towards the commercial translation system, especially on low-resource languages. Through further analysis, we discover that LLMs exhibit new working patterns when used for MMT. First, instruction semantics can surprisingly be ignored when given in-context exemplars. Second, cross-lingual exemplars can provide better task guidance for low-resource translation than exemplars in the same language pairs. Third, LLM can acquire translation ability in a resource-efficient way and generate moderate translation even on zero-resource languages.",

        "Abstract": " Event grounding aims at linking mention references in text corpora to events from a knowledge base (KB). Previous work on this task focused primarily on linking to a single KB event, thereby overlooking the hierarchical aspects of events. Events in documents are typically described at various levels of spatio-temporal granularity. These hierarchical relations are utilized in downstream tasks of narrative understanding and schema construction. In this work, we present an extension to the event grounding task that requires tackling hierarchical event structures from the KB. Our proposed task involves linking a mention reference to a set of event labels from a subevent hierarchy in the KB. We propose a retrieval methodology that leverages event hierarchy through an auxiliary hierarchical loss. On an automatically created multilingual dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical loss against retrieve and re-rank baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the systems' ability to aid hierarchical discovery among unseen events. Code is available at https//github.com/JefferyO/Hierarchical-Event-Grounding",

        "Abstract": " The recent explosion of interest in multimodal applications has resulted in a wide selection of datasets and methods for representing and inte-grating information from different signals. Despite these empirical advances, there remain fundamental research questions how can we quantify the nature of interactions that exist among input features? Subsequently, how can we capture these interactions using suitable data-driven methods? To answer this question, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of redundancy , uniqueness , and synergy across input features, which we term the PID statistics of a multimodal distribution. Using 2 newly proposed estimators that scale to high-dimensional distributions, we demonstrate their usefulness in quantifying the interactions within multimodal datasets, the nature of interactions captured by multimodal models, and principled approaches for model selection. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where the PID statistics are known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID estimation was previously impossible. Finally, to demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach, we present three case studies in pathology, mood prediction, and robotic perception where our framework accurately recommends strong multimodal models for each application.",

This necessitates not only an interpretable model but also interpretable features. In particular, language must be featurized in a way that is interpretable while still characterizing the original text well. We present SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations. Given a passage of text, SenteCon encodes the text as a layer of interpretable categories in which each dimension corresponds to the relevance of a specific category. Our empirical evaluations indicate that encoding language with SenteCon provides high-level interpretability at little to no cost to predictive performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, we find that SenteCon outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and its agreement with human characterizations of the text.",

        "Abstract": " Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a person\u2019s future observations based on their past labeled observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends (a) trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters ruling out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere in a neural network in a scalable manner1. NME combines the efficiency of neural network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states. Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset shows interpretable trends related to the mother\u2019s depression symptoms.",

To investigate this question, we compared dyadic interactions between 73 depressed and 75 non-depressed mothers and their adolescent child. Families were of low income and 84% were white. Child behavior was measured from audio-video recordings using manual annotation of verbal and nonverbal behavior by expert coders and by multimodal computational measures of facial expression, face and head dynamics, prosody, speech behavior, and linguistics. For both sets of measures, we used Support Vector Machines. For computational measures, we investigated the relative contribution of single versus multiple modalities using a novel approach to SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Computational measures outperformed manual ratings by human experts. Among individual computational measures, prosody was the most informative. SHAP reduction resulted in a four-fold decrease in the number of features and highest performance (77% accuracy; positive and negative agreements at 75% and 76%, respectively).

        "Abstract": " In real-world machine learning systems, labels are often derived from user behaviors that the system wishes to encourage. Over time, new models must be trained as new training examples and features become available. However, feedback loops between users and models can bias future user behavior, inducing a presentation bias in the labels that compromises the ability to train new models. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation, a novel causal method for correcting presentation bias using generated counterfactual labels. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that counterfactual augmentation yields better downstream performance compared to both uncorrected models and existing bias-correction methods. Model analyses further indicate that the generated counterfactuals align closely with true counterfactuals in an oracle setting.",

However, while most approaches randomly mask tokens, there is strong intuition that deciding what to mask can substantially improve learning outcomes. We investigate this in continued pretraining setting in which pretrained models continue to pretrain on domain-specific data before performing some downstream task. We introduce Difference-Masking, a masking strategy that automatically chooses what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain different from the pretraining domain. Empirically, we find that Difference-Masking outperforms baselines on continued pretraining settings across four diverse language-only and multimodal video tasks.",

This paper describes our examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas. We examined over 16,000 papers from selected conferences in multimodal interaction, affective computing, and natural language processing ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, AAAC International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. We identified 910 affect-related papers and present our analysis of the role of affective phenomena in these papers. We find that this body of research has primarily focused on enabling machines to recognize or express affect and emotion; there has been limited research on how affect and emotion predictions might, in turn, be used by AI systems to enhance machine understanding of human social behaviors and cognitive states. Based on our analysis, we discuss directions to expand the role of affective phenomena in multimodal interaction research.",

        "Abstract": " In order to perform multimodal fusion of heterogeneous signals, we need to understand their interactions how each modality individually provides information useful for a task and how this information changes in the presence of other modalities. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of how humans annotate two categorizations of multimodal interactions (1) partial labels, where different annotators annotate the label given the first, second, and both modalities, and (2) counterfactual labels, where the same annotator annotates the label given the first modality before asking them to explicitly reason about how their answer changes when given the second. We further propose an alternative taxonomy based on (3) information decomposition, where annotators annotate the degrees of redundancy the extent to which modalities individually and together give the same predictions, uniqueness the extent to which one modality enables a prediction that the other does not, and synergy the extent to which both modalities enable one to make a prediction that one would not otherwise make using individual modalities. Through experiments and annotations, we highlight several opportunities and limitations of each approach and propose a method to automatically convert annotations of partial and counterfactual labels to information decomposition, yielding an accurate and efficient method for quantifying multimodal interactions.",

        "Abstract": " In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of multimodal interactions the emergence of new task-relevant information during learning from both modalities that was not present in either alone. We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contributions are the derivations of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds based on the amount of shared information between modalities and the disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, two semi-supervised multimodal applications are explored based on these theoretical results (1) analyzing the relationship between multimodal performance and estimated interactions, and (2) self-supervised learning that embraces disagreement between modalities beyond agreement as is typically done.",

        "Abstract": " Characterizing the dynamics of behavior across multiple modalities and individuals is a vital component of computational behavior analysis. This is especially important in certain applications, such as psychotherapy, where individualized tracking of behavior patterns can provide valuable information about the patient\u2019s mental state. Conventional methods that rely on aggregate statistics and correlational metrics may not always suffice, as they are often unable to capture causal relationships or evaluate the true probability of identified patterns. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach to learning multimodal and interpersonal representations of behavior dynamics during one-on-one interaction. Our approach is enabled by the introduction of a multiview extension of latent change score models, which facilitates the concurrent capture of both inter-modal and interpersonal behavior dynamics and the identification of directional relationships between them. A core advantage of our approach is its high level of interpretability while simultaneously achieving strong predictive performance. We evaluate our approach within the domain of therapist-client interactions, with the objective of gaining a deeper understanding about the collaborative relationship between the two, a crucial element of the therapeutic process. Our results demonstrate improved performance over conventional approaches that rely upon summary statistics or correlational metrics. Furthermore, since our multiview approach includes the explicit modeling of uncertainty, it naturally lends itself to integration with probabilistic classifiers, such as Gaussian process models. We demonstrate that this integration leads to even further improved performance, all the while maintaining highly interpretable qualities. Our analysis provides compelling motivation for further exploration of stochastic systems within computational models of behavior.",

However, modern multimodal models and interfaces are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize their internal workings in order to empower stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model debugging, and promote trust in these models? Our paper proposes MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models via 4 stages (1) unimodal importance, (2) cross-modal interactions, (3) multimodal representations and (4) multimodal prediction. MultiViz includes modular visualization tools for each stage before combining outputs from all stages through an interactive and human-in-the-loop API. Through user studies with 21 participants on 8 trained models across 6 real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications, and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models.

Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking. In this work, we formally characterize and justify existing empirical in-sights and provide theoretical guarantees of MAE. We formulate the underlying data-generating process as a hierarchical latent variable model, and show that under reasonable assumptions, MAE provably identifies a set of latent variables in the hierarchical model, explaining why MAE can extract high-level information from pixels. Further, we show how key hyperparameters in MAE (the masking ratio and the patch size) determine which true latent variables to be recovered, therefore influencing the level of semantic information in the representation. Specifically, extremely large or small masking ratios inevitably lead to low-level representations. Our theory offers coherent explanations of existing empirical observations and provides insights for potential empirical improvements and fundamental limitations of the masked-reconstruction paradigm. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical insights.",

        "Abstract": " In a wide range of multimodal tasks, contrastive learning has become a particularly appealing approach since it can successfully learn representations from abundant unlabeled data with only pairing information (e.g., image-caption or video-audio pairs). Underpinning these approaches is the assumption of multi-view redundancy - that shared information between modalities is necessary and sufficient for downstream tasks. However, in many real-world settings, task-relevant information is also contained in modality-unique regions information that is only present in one modality but still relevant to the task. How can we learn self-supervised multimodal representations to capture both shared and unique information relevant to downstream tasks? This paper proposes FactorCL, a new multimodal representation learning method to go beyond multi-view redundancy. FactorCL is built from three new contributions (1) factorizing task-relevant information into shared and unique representations, (2) capturing task-relevant information via maximizing MI lower bounds and removing task-irrelevant information via minimizing MI upper bounds, and (3) multimodal data augmentations to approximate task relevance without labels. On large-scale real-world datasets, FactorCL captures both shared and unique information and achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks",

Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced. Since our proposed method only needs a few training examples, we argue that our few-shot de-biasing approach is highly feasible and practical. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our de-biasing technique performs better than competitive state-of-the-art baselines with minimal loss in language modeling ability.",

The API vendors charge their users based on usage, more specifically on the number of ``tokens'' processed or generated by the underlying language models. What constitutes a token, however, is training data and model dependent with a large variance in the number of tokens required to convey the same information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non-uniformity on the fairness of an API's pricing policy across languages. We conduct a systematic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI's language model API on multilingual benchmarks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large number of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speakers tend to also come from regions where the APIs are less affordable to begin with. Through these analyses, we aim to increase transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage the vendors to make them more equitable.",

Prior multilingual benchmarks are static and have focused on a limited number of tasks and languages. In contrast, GlobalBench is an ever-expanding collection that aims to dynamically track progress on all NLP datasets in all languages. Rather than solely measuring accuracy, GlobalBench also tracks the estimated per-speaker utility and equity of technology across all languages, providing a multi-faceted view of how language technology is serving people of the world. Furthermore, GlobalBench is designed to identify the most under-served languages, and rewards research efforts directed towards those languages. At present, the most under-served languages are the ones with a relatively high population, but nonetheless overlooked by composite multilingual benchmarks (like Punjabi, Portuguese, and Wu Chinese).

While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program's performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code.",

        "Title": " CodeBERTScore Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code",
        "Abstract": " Since the rise of neural natural-language-to-code models (NL->Code) that can generate long expressions and statements rather than a single next-token, one of the major problems has been reliably evaluating their generated output. In this paper, we propose CodeBERTScore an evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020). Instead of encoding only the generated tokens as in BERTScore, CodeBERTScore also encodes the natural language input preceding the generated code, thus modeling the consistency between the generated code and its given natural language context as well. We perform an extensive evaluation of CodeBERTScore across four programming languages. We find that CodeBERTScore achieves a higher correlation with human preference and with functional correctness than all existing metrics. That is, generated code that receives a higher score by CodeBERTScore is more likely to be preferred by humans, as well as to function correctly when executed. We release five language-specific pretrained models to use with our publicly available code. Our language-specific models have been downloaded more than 1,000,000 times from the Huggingface Hub. Our code and data are available at https//github.com/neulab/code-bert-score",

        "Abstract": " Neural models have drastically advanced state of the art for machine translation (MT) between high-resource languages. Traditionally, these models rely on large amounts of training data, but many language pairs lack these resources. However, an important part of the languages in the world do not have this amount of data. Most languages from the Americas are among them, having a limited amount of parallel and monolingual data, if any. Here, we present an introduction to the interested reader to the basic challenges, concepts, and techniques that involve the creation of MT systems for these languages. Finally, we discuss the recent advances and findings and open questions, product of an increased interest of the NLP community in these languages.",

        "Abstract": " There has been recent interest in improving optical character recognition (OCR) for endangered languages, particularly because a large number of documents and books in these languages are not in machine-readable formats. The performance of OCR systems is typically evaluated using automatic metrics such as character and word error rates. While error rates are useful for the comparison of different models and systems, they do not measure whether and how the transcriptions produced from OCR tools are useful to downstream users. In this paper, we present a human-centric evaluation of OCR systems, focusing on the Kwak'wala language as a case study. With a user study, we show that utilizing OCR reduces the time spent in the manual transcription of culturally valuable documents -- a task that is often undertaken by endangered language community members and researchers -- by over 50%. Our results demonstrate the potential benefits that OCR tools can have on downstream language documentation and revitalization efforts.",

        "Abstract": " Evaluation of natural language generation (NLG) is complex and multi-dimensional. Generated text can be evaluated for fluency, coherence, factuality, or any other dimensions of interest. Most frameworks that perform such multi-dimensional evaluation require training on large manually or synthetically generated datasets. In this paper, we study the efficacy of large language models as multi-dimensional evaluators using in-context learning, obviating the need for large training datasets. Our experiments show that in-context learning-based evaluators are competitive with learned evaluation frameworks for the task of text summarization, establishing state-of-the-art on dimensions such as relevance and factual consistency. We then analyze the effects of factors such as the selection and number of in-context examples on performance. Finally, we study the efficacy of in-context learning based evaluators in evaluating zero-shot summaries written by large language models such as GPT-3.",

        "Title": " A Gold Standard Dataset for the Reviewer Assignment Problem",
        "Abstract": " Many peer-review venues are either using or looking to use algorithms to assign submissions to reviewers. The crux of such automated approaches is the notion of the\"similarity score\"--a numerical estimate of the expertise of a reviewer in reviewing a paper--and many algorithms have been proposed to compute these scores. However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a principled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the algorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing algorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of the publicly available gold-standard data that would be needed to perform reproducible research. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity scores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477 self-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously. We use this data to compare several popular algorithms employed in computer science conferences and come up with recommendations for stakeholders. Our main findings are as follows. First, all algorithms make a non-trivial amount of error. For the task of ordering two papers in terms of their relevance for a reviewer, the error rates range from 12%-30% in easy cases to 36%-43% in hard cases, highlighting the vital need for more research on the similarity-computation problem. Second, most existing algorithms are designed to work with titles and abstracts of papers, and in this regime the Specter+MFR algorithm performs best. Third, to improve performance, it may be important to develop modern deep-learning based algorithms that can make use of the full texts of papers the classical TD-IDF algorithm enhanced with full texts of papers is on par with the deep-learning based Specter+MFR that cannot make use of this information.",

For data augmentation, we explore two approaches creating artificial data from the provided training data and utilizing existing IGT resources in other languages. On the modeling side, we test an enhanced version of the provided token classification baseline as well as a pretrained multilingual seq2seq model. Additionally, we apply post-correction using a dictionary for Gitksan, the language with the smallest amount of data. We find that our token classification models are the best performing, with the highest word-level accuracy for Arapaho and highest morpheme-level accuracy for Gitksan out of all submissions. We also show that data augmentation is an effective strategy, though applying artificial data pretraining has very different effects across both models tested.",

        "Abstract": " Many recent advances in natural language generation have been fueled by training large language models on internet-scale data. However, this paradigm can lead to models that generate toxic, inaccurate, and unhelpful content, and automatic evaluation metrics often fail to identify these behaviors. As models become more capable, human feedback is an invaluable signal for evaluating and improving models. This survey aims to provide an overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation. First, we introduce an encompassing formalization of feedback, and identify and organize existing research into a taxonomy following this formalization. Next, we discuss how feedback can be described by its format and objective, and cover the two approaches proposed to use feedback (either for training or decoding) directly using the feedback or training feedback models. We also discuss existing datasets for human-feedback data collection, and concerns surrounding feedback collection. Finally, we provide an overview of the nascent field of AI feedback, which exploits large language models to make judgments based on a set of principles and minimize the need for human intervention.",

        "Abstract": " The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual errors in the generated text. In particular (1) A wider range of tasks now face an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method. We release the code of FacTool associated with ChatGPT plugin interface at https//github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool .",

        "Title": " Active Retrieval Augmented Generation",
        "Abstract": " Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https//github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE.",

        "Abstract": " Unlike traditional unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering allows users to provide meaningful structure to the data, which helps the clustering algorithm to match the user's intent. Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model can amplify an expert's guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find incorporating LLMs in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters. We release our code and LLM prompts for the public to use.",

Similarly, if a system can have discussions with humans when solving tasks, it can improve the system's performance and reliability. In previous research on explainability, it has only been possible for the system to make predictions and for humans to ask questions about them rather than having a mutual exchange of opinions. This research aims to create a dataset and computational framework for systems that discuss and refine their predictions through dialogue. Through experiments, we show that the proposed system can have beneficial discussions with humans improving the accuracy by up to 25 points in the natural language inference task.",

        "Abstract": " Idioms are common in everyday language, but often pose a challenge to translators because their meanings do not follow from the meanings of their parts. Despite significant advances, machine translation systems still struggle to translate idiomatic expressions. We provide a simple characterization of idiomatic translation and related issues. This allows us to conduct a synthetic experiment revealing a tipping point at which transformer-based machine translation models correctly default to idiomatic translations. To expand multilingual resources, we compile a dataset of ~4k natural sentences containing idiomatic expressions in French, Finnish, and Japanese. To improve translation of natural idioms, we introduce two straightforward yet effective techniques the strategic upweighting of training loss on potentially idiomatic sentences, and using retrieval-augmented models. This not only improves the accuracy of a strong pretrained MT model on idiomatic sentences by up to 13% in absolute accuracy, but also holds potential benefits for non-idiomatic sentences.",
