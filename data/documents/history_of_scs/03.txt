Games and drills, such as flash cards, have long been used to help students learn tough subjects.

Cognitive tutors were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. Today, cognitive tutors teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year.
