Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. \\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the \\nstandards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is \\nrare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. \\nThe discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a \\ncommitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \\ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit  for prior knowledge. \\nWithout the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community \\ncannot exist. \\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high \\nrespect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by \", metadata={'source': '/home/raj/nlp/cmu-rag/data/documents/_Combined_All_Files/Acads_LTI_handbook-msaii-2022-2023.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='8 \\n\\xa0their failure to meet these standards.

(Please note that Core courses and \\nKnowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be  allowed to retake a required \\ncourse only once.  If a student fails in the second attemp t, he or she will be dropped from the \\nMSAII program.    \\nIf a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute \\ncourse (equivalent course approved by the Director).    \\nAll grades count towards the program QPA, exce pt for repeated courses, in which case the final \\ngrade replaces the previous grade.  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA.  \\nHowever, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE  TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost \\ndirects to the contrary.

An internship will provide stu dents with the opportunity to \\napply the knowledge and technical skills learned d uring the first year of the program, to gain \\ninsight into AI and future marke t needs to further their experienc e and develop a strong context \\nfor the second-year concentration coursework.  No rmally the internship wi ll be with an outside \\ncompany.  In some circumstances, a student wh o is doing research with  a CMU faculty member \\nduring the summer may request that such  research qualify as an internship. \\nThe internship must involve at le ast two months of full-time work  and must relate to computer \\nsoftware development and is preferably AI-related. \\nStudents are encouraged to intern with an organiza tion that corresponds to their individual area \\nof interest and career goals.   \\nAll students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI \\nPracticum).  This course can be taken once du ring the program with Pass/Fail and will be \\ncounted toward graduation units.  Internationa l students must apply for Curricular Practical \\nTraining (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To \\nobtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling  out employment dates, work hours, and wages \\nor stipend.  It is the student’s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester \\nfollowing the internship to a ll current MSAII students detailing the student’s internship \\nexperience. \\nInternational students who are in terested in working in  the U.S after graduation are required to \\nconsult with the Office of International Educat ion (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.  \\nNote: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon. \\xa0\\nNOTE : Students are personally respon sible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and \\nProfessional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and \\ninternship opportunity listings in Handshake .  We strongly suggest students begin the \\ninternship search beginnin g in the Fall of your first year. So me internship opportunities have \\napplication deadlines in the Fall,  so by starting your search ea rly, you won't miss out on these \\ninternships.  The Career and Pr ofessional Development Center will assist students with the \\ninternship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the \\nstudents’ responsibility.   \\nThe following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.

See Section 3.1, Co urse Grade and GPA Requirements, above. \\nAt the end of the semester, the faculty evaluate s each student\\'s academic progress. If a student \\nseems to be having trouble, th e faculty determines whether it believes that the student can \\nfinish the degree, and if  so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of \\nletter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the \\nstudent\\'s record; if the student begins making sa tisfactory progress again, there is no official \\nrecord of the letter in the student\\'s transcript. \\nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the stud ent a letter that specifies a list of conditions \\nthat the student must satisfy by specific deadlines . Failure to meet all of the specified conditions \\nmay result in the student\\'s te rmination from the program.

The policy incl udes the University expectations around academic \\nintegrity and provides definitions of cheati ng, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  \\nA review of the University’s Academ ic Disciplinary Actions procedures \\n(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/th eword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also \\nrecommended. These procedures outline the proc ess for investigating, reporting, and \\nadjudicating violations of the University Policy  on Academic Integrit y. The procedures also \\noutline the appeal process. \\nIt is an absolute requirement  that the work you submit must be your own, unless you \\nspecifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours.  This includes quotations and \\nmaterial from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any \\nperson other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk.  Any student who violates \\nthe academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in \\nsuspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE \\nFACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE \\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   \\nYou are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them \\nas your own work.  Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST \\nbe accompanied by a citation to the original source.   Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources \\nis required. … Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other \\nindividuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another \\nsource for either written or oral use must be  fully acknowledged in academic work to be \\ngraded.” \\nIt is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to \\nprovide your work to others to assist them.  Be cause team deliverables are the product of joint \\nwork, it is the responsibility of each member of  a team to ensure that all team materials have \\nbeen produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given fo r work that is not a \\nstudent’s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying \\nmaterial from the Internet without indicating it s source, then no one on the team can receive \\ncredit for that work, even if only one studen t is directly guilty of violating the policy. \\nWe are aware that acts that constitute cheating  can be viewed very di fferently in different \\ncountries and cultures.  However, Carnegie Me llon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect \\nU.S. culture.  Employers expect that students  who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have \\nobtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies.  If you have any \\ndoubt whether proposed conduct would be consi dered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, \\nASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.

The faculty do not ha ve the option to decli ne to make a report.  The \\noffending student will receive an email to inform them of an A cademic Integrity Violation (AIV). \\nThe email will specify the offense and the penalt y, and will inform the student of available \\nappeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased. \\nImportant note:   The university policy gives a depart ment the option of “conven[ing] a \\ndisciplinary hearing according to the procedure s of the department/pro gram.”  The LTI has a \\n“two strikes” rule.  The LTI may terminate a st udent for a first violation, depending upon the \\ncircumstances and severity of the violation.

(Add form can be found at \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )   \\n11.1.8 Dropping a Course  \\nDropping courses is not recommended except for reas ons of health or fami ly emergency.  Many \\nSCS courses have long waitlist s, and dropping a course means that some other student who \\nmight have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students \\nin the MSAII program drop courses, then the inst ructors of those courses may no longer allow \\nMSAIIs to enroll. \\nSometimes, however, a student’s workload can  become unexpectedly heavy because of course \\nrequirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure a nd dropping a course may \\nbecome a necessity.

Master's st udents are permitted one drop voucher per year \\nof study and may use only one voucher per se mester (including summer).  Courses dropped \\nusing a voucher will be removed from the student' s record, as long as the drop is confirmed in \\nSIO by the student within 24 hours of rece iving the automated voucher email (refer to \\ninstructions below). Students may use drop vouche rs up until the last day of classes each \\nsemester.  These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-\\nchanges/index.html . \\nNote that the Core courses and some Knowledg e courses are only offe red once per year so \\ndropping a course may delay program completion.  \\nNote:  International students must maintain a minimu m of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. \\ngovernment’s visa requirement.

This decision rests with the program director, on \\nthe advice of the faculty memb er for whose course an exempt ion is sought. If a student is \\nexempt  from a required course due to  prior courses or experience, the student can replace that \\ncourse with an open elective. The student does  not receive credit for the exempted course but \\ncan take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student \\nreceives credit  for prior coursework completed at Car negie Mellon or elsewhere, the student \\nreceives that many units of credit and the to tal amount of required coursework is reduced by \\nthat amount. \\n11.4.3  Employment/Consulting \\nSince consulting provides useful experience, stu dents are generally permitted to consult at most \\none day per seven-day week, with the Program Di rector's consent.  International students must \\nalso have approval in advance from the Office  of International Educat ion (OIE) for any paid \\nposition.  Students may use their consulting time to perform unpa id work on research projects \\nfor CMU faculty for up to 10 hours per week. \\nStudents may serve as teaching assistants for CMU faculty.   TA work is inconsistent with \\nresearch because of the necessary time commitm ent.  Students must choose one activity or the \\nother, not both. \\nNote that there is an English language proficienc y requirement for TAs.  Graduate students are \\nrequired to have a certain level of  fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as \\nrequired by the English Fluency in Higher Ed ucation Act of 1990. Through this Act, all \\ninstitutions of higher educatio n in the state are required to ev aluate and certify the English \\nfluency of all instructional personnel, includ ing teaching assistants and interns.

Grading is a matter of  sound discretion of \\nthe instructor and final grades are rarely ch anged without the consent of the instructor who \\nassigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a \\ngrade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a cours e is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error \\nsuch as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), \\nor (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University \\npolicy \\n11.5.4  Safeguarding Educational Equity: \\nPolicy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault \\nThe University prohibits sex-based discriminati on, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ \\ndomestic violence and stalking.

CMU has spent decades successfully developing a \\nnon-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to  interfere with that \\naccomplishment. \\nConsensual Intimate Relationship Poli cy Regarding Undergraduate Students \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-s tudent-life/consensual-relationships.html  \\nThis policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate \\nstudents as a TA or in a research lab/studio se tting.  This policy addresses the circumstances in \\nwhich romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/ interactions with undergraduate students, \\neven if consensual, are inappropriate and prohib ited. The purpose of this policy is to assure \\nhealthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discoura ge consensual intimate \\nrelationships unless there is a conflicting profe ssional relationship in  which one party has \\nauthority over the other as in the policy. \\n11.5.5  Cultural Tolerance \\nThe MSAII program is extremely diverse for a pr ogram of its size. We have students from \\nnumerous different countries who must work effectively in a team se tting.  The students \\ninvariably come from very different cultures that  have differing attitudes  towards age, gender, \\nand group interaction.  The program management understands this, but th e students must also \\nrecognize that this program is being conducted in  the United States and operates according to \\nU.S. norms.  Students and faculty,  regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each \\nother respectfully without insult or raised voices .  It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any \\nother way.  Violations will be dealt with harshly.  The Program Director is not sympathetic to \\nsuch behavior, which will not be tolerated.  Re peated infractions, or a serious single infraction \\nmay result in termination from the program. \\n11.5.6  Language Policy \\nThe MSAII program is a component of the Language  Technologies Institute, which studies and \\ncelebrates the diversity of human language and fo rms of expression.  The LTI also recognizes the \\nfutility and unfairness of attempting to det ermine the language students must use when \\ncommunicating.  However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language ', metadata={'source': '/home/raj/nlp/cmu-rag/data/documents/_Combined_All_Files/Acads_LTI_handbook-msaii-2022-2023.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content=\"32 \\n\\xa0that is not understood by all team members.  Fo r example, if all members of a team understand \\nChinese, then they may use Chi nese in team meetings.  However,  if even one team member does \\nnot understand Chinese, then a language must be us ed that is understood by all team members.  \\nIt is recommended that non-native speakers of Eng lish use English as much as possible if they \\nintend to seek employment in  an English-speaking country. \\n11.5.7  Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol \\nThe Maternity Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-\\nservices/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html . \\nStudents whose anticipated delivery date is duri ng the course of the semester may consider \\ntaking time away from their coursework and re search responsibilities. All female students who \\ngive birth to a child while engaged in coursework or  research are eligible to take either a short-\\nterm absence or formal leave of absence. St udents in course work should consider either \\nworking with their course instructor to receive in complete grades or elect to drop to part-time \\nstatus or to take a semester leave of absence.   Students engaged in research must work with \\ntheir faculty to develop plans for the re search for the time  they are away.  \\n● Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity \\nAccommodations. Students will complete an info rmation form and meet with a member of the \\nDean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. \\n○ Planning for the student’s discussio n with appropriate academic contact(s) \\n(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting. \\n● Students in course work should consider op tions for the semester of the anticipated \\nbirth such as working with their course instructo rs to receive incomplete grades, electing to \\ndrop to part-time status or taking  a full semester leave of absence. \\n● Students engaged in research  must work with their facu lty to develop plans for the \\nresearch for the time they are aw ay and for resuming upon return. \\n● Master's students who receive an academ ic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are \\neligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) week s during a Short-Term \\nMaternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six \\nweeks is medically necessary.

Once this time-to-degree li mit has lapsed, the person may resume work \\ntowards a master’s degree only if newly admitted  to a currently offered master’s degree program \\nunder criteria determined by that program. \\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or \\nparental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's \\nrecommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a \\nperiod commensurate with the duration of that  interruption. Students who are pursuing a \\nmaster’s degree as part-time students for all seme sters of their program,  as approved by their \\nprogram, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree \\nlimit.  \\nAny request for a waiver of the statute of limita tions must be approved by  the Department Head \\nand by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the \\nexceptional circumstances that wa rrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, \\nthe waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the \\nprogram. \\nSee also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy. \\n11.7 Residency Requirement \\nThe MSAII is a full-time, in-resid ence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus.  In \\nexceptional circumstances, such as visa compli cations or medical exigencies, permission may be \\ngranted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program \\nremotely.  This is not possible for first-year students. \\n12 Financial Issues \\n12.1 Graduate Student Funding  \", metadata={'source': '/home/raj/nlp/cmu-rag/data/documents/_Combined_All_Files/Acads_LTI_handbook-msaii-2022-2023.pdf', 'page': 32}), Document(page_content='34 \\n\\xa0The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.  \\nStudents are encouraged to seek financial aid and s upport from other sources.
