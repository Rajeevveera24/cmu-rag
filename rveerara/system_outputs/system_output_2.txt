 The proposed learning objective to improve perceptual quality of speech is to formalize differences in perceptual quality by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics, and develop a neural network estimator that can accurately predict non-differentiable temporal acoustic parameters across an utterance. This objective aims to optimize speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features, thereby enhancing the overall perceptual quality of the generated speech.

 CSurF addresses sparse lexicon-based retrieval by directly bridging the surface form space and term semantics space in exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSFs). It represents each query and document as a "bag-of-CSFs", expanding vocabulary with surface forms and representing term meaning with contextual semantic vectors. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through learned surface forms and effectively scores via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in term match and term scoring.

 Modeling the conversation with entity graphs can be used to improve retrieval of answer passages for the current question by predicting each entity's centrality in the conversation and using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs. This helps improve top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines.

 The solution proposed in the BASS paper from Interspeech 2023 is to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner using block-wise modeling. This involves processing a portion of the input frames at a time and updating hypothesis summaries every block based on new acoustic information.
 One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning in young children is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack & Woodruff (1978).

 The proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View" is to reconstruct the 3D facial shape from voice using a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm. This approach identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction, bypassing the need for semantic information.

 The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain is by keeping the language model frozen and finetuning input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows the model to process and generate arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text data, and produce retrieved images, generated images, and generated text.
