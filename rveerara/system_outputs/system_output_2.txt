 Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland to Pittsburgh in 1848.
 Reciprocal rank is found to have brittleness, which makes it difficult to discriminate between systems in modern evaluation settings with high-precision systems. This issue is addressed by introducing and connecting reciprocal rank to the concept of best-case retrieval and lexicographic precision, improving sensitivity and robustness across a broad set of tasks.
 The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain is by leveraging the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. It involves keeping the language model frozen and fine-tuning input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows the model to process and generate arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text data.
