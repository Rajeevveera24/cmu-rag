 The issue found in reciprocal rank is its brittleness when discriminating between systems and lack of sensitivity for best-case retrieval.
 The method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain is by fusing frozen text-only large language models with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, mapping between their embedding spaces. This enables the model to process and generate arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text data using input and output linear layers for cross-modality interactions.
