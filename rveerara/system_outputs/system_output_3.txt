 The paper "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" investigates the ability of large language models to suggest functionally correct, performance-improving code edits. The authors hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. They curate a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits (PIE) and use it to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, they use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, they use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, they find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, they show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code.
