CodeBERTScore encodes additional information beyond the generated tokens in addition to the generated tokens. It uses a combination of semantic and syntactic features to capture the context and meaning of the input text. These features include:  * Wordpiece-level representations: Each word in the input text is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space, capturing its semantic meaning and context. * Positional encodings: The position of each word in the sequence is encoded to capture its syntactic information. * Attention weights: The model learns to attend to different parts of the input sequence based on their relevance to the task at hand, allowing it to focus on the most important words and phrases.  These encodings are combined using a multi-layer transformer network to produce the final output representation.

Black-box nature: Diffusion models are typically black-box neural networks, making it challenging to understand their internal mechanics and promote trust in these models.
