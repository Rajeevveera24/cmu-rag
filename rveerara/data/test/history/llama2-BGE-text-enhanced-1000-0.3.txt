I don't know who was awarded the first doctorate at CMU.
 The Carnegie Plan was initiated in 1908.
I don't know the answer to your question. The context you provided does not provide enough information to determine when the first IBM computer arrived at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus. Can you provide more context or clarify the question?
I don't know.
Sure, I can help you with that! The Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campuses outside of Pittsburgh are located in:  * Silicon Valley, California (Carnegie Mellon University - Silicon Valley) * San Diego, California (Carnegie Mellon University - San Diego) * Qatar (Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar)
I don't know the answer to your question.
 The person from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) who was awarded the Turing Award in 1975 is Alan J. Perlis.
Pushbar
 Buggy races are also known as karts or go-karts.
I'm happy to help! According to the context you provided, there are currently 125 different countries represented by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) students.
I don't know the percentage of CMU computer science first-year students who were women in 2019.
According to US News and World Report's 2022 rankings, the Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering is ranked #6 globally.
I don't know the answer to that question. The origin of the first smile in an email is not well-documented or widely known.
Professor Louis von Ahn is known for his work in the field of cryptography and computer science. He is credited with inventing the concept of "human-based computation," which leverages the collective power of humans to solve complex computational problems that are too difficult or time-consuming for computers to handle on their own. This led to the development of the first human-powered computing platform, called "Human Computation" or "HuCom." Von Ahn's work has applications in fields such as medicine, environmental science, and social media analysis.
I don't know when Carnegie Mellon University awarded its first degree in drama.
I don't know.
I don't know the answer to that question.
I don't know the answer to your question. The information provided in the context does not provide enough information to determine when the kiltie band began. Can you provide more context or clarify the question?
I don't know the answer to your question. The information you provided does not provide enough context to determine how many students formed the Kiltie band. Can you please provide more details or clarify the question?
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about Kiltie band rehearsal schedules or football season dates. However, based on the context provided, I can tell you that Kiltie band rehearsals are likely to happen during the weekdays and weekends, depending on the availability of the members and the venue. As I don't have access to the specific schedule, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question.
I don't know the answer to your question.
I don't know the answer to that question.
I don't know the percentage of students who voted for Scotty the Scottish Terrier to be Carnegie Mellon University's mascot.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to information beyond what is available in the public domain or what has been explicitly shared with me. I don't know when the official Scotty costume was unveiled.
 I'm not able to provide information on the establishment of a specific computer science department as I'm just an AI and do not have access to real-time information or historical records. However, I can suggest some resources where you may be able to find the information you are looking for:  * Check the website of the university or institution where the computer science department is located. They may have a section on their history or timeline that includes the establishment date of the department. * Look for books or articles on the history of computer science or the department itself. These resources may provide information on when the department was established and by whom. * Search online databases or archives that contain historical records related to computer science or the university. You may be able to find information on the establishment of the department in these sources.
I don't know the exact date of creation for the robotics institute.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about the design of a particular logic theorist. However, I can tell you that logic theorists are typically designed using a variety of algorithms and techniques that are based on mathematical concepts and principles. The exact date or time when a logic theorist was designed is not something I am aware of. My apologies for any confusion.
 The first system capable of continuous speech recognition was designed by Dr. John F. Mitchell and his team at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1970s.
James Golseth developed a machine learning model for predicting patient outcomes in critical care settings.
 The first AI program was named "Logical Theorist" (LTP).
