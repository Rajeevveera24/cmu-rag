1975 - Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on  Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA. Three years after, Langford and Blum created reCAPTCHA.  achieve grandmaster status with Hitech, developed by CS’74 alumnus Hans Berliner.  Could a computer play chess at the level of the world’s best players? For many years, it was considered the “holy grail” of artificial intelligence.

Creation of the first smile in an email is not a specific recorded event, as it relies on the implementation and usage of emoticons within electronic communication platforms like emails. As such, there is no definitive answer to the creation of the first smile in an email. The history of emoticons in digital communication begins with the use of typographical symbols to convey emotions or feelings in text-based messages. These early forms of emoticons appeared in the late 19th century and were called "punctuation marks." As technology advanced, so did the availability and ease of using emoticons in emails. The first commercial email service provider that offered emoticons was Compuserve, which introduced them to its users in the early 1980s. Since then, various platforms have incorporated built-in emoticons into their email services, and many users have created their own unique variations or custom emoticons to express emotions. Therefore, there is no specific creator of the first smile in an email as it relies on the availability of emoticons in emails, which has evolved over time with advancements in digital communication technology.
