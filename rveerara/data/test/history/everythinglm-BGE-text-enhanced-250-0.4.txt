    Professor Louis von Ahn is known for his invention of reCAPTCHA, a CAPTCHA (Completay Challenge Response Test to Prove You are Human) system that combines the process of digitally transcribing books with the verification of user input. This innovative system uses the recognition of distorted text from books as a way to determine if someone is a human user or a malicious bot, making it more secure than traditional CAPTCHAs. von Ahn's invention not only revolutionized online security but also contributed to the preservation of historical literature by providing an automated transcription process for digitizing books.
