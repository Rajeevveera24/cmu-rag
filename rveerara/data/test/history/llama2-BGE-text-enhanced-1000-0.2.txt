 The first doctorate awarded at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was granted to Jared Lee Linsday in 1902.
 The Carnegie Plan was initiated in 1908 by Andrew Carnegie.
The first IBM computer arrived at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus in 1957.
I don't know the answer to your question. The information you provided does not contain any information about when Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute.
CMU has multiple campuses outside of Pittsburgh, including:  * Main Campus in Heinz Field, Pittsburgh * North Campus in Coraopolis * South Campus in Moon Township * Greater Pittsburgh Area locations in McCandless and Shadyside  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
I don't know the answer to your question.
Sure, I'd be happy to help! The person from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) who was awarded the Turing Award in 1975 is Andrew S. Tanenbaum.

 Buggy races are also known as karts or go-karts.
I don't know the exact number of countries that CMU students represent.
I don't know the percentage of CMU computer science first-year students who were women in 2019.
 According to US News and World Report 2022, the rank of Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering is #5 in the world.
I don't know who created the first smile in an email or when it was created.
 Professor Louis von Ahn is a computer science professor known for his work on cryptography and secure multi-party computation. He has invented several important technologies in these fields, including:  * Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): a technique for computing functions on private data without revealing the data itself. * Verifiable Computation: a system for verifying the correctness of computations without revealing the inputs. * CryptoFirewall: a secure communication protocol for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. 
 CMU awarded its first degree in drama in 1930.
I don't know the answer to your question.
I don't know the exact number of downloads for the app invented by Professor Von Ahn in 12 months.
 The Kiltie Band was established in 1928 at Michigan State University.
I don't know the answer to that question.
I don't know the answer to your question. The context you provided does not provide enough information to determine when Kiltie band rehearsals occur during football season. Can you please provide more details or clarify the question?
I'm not able to access real-time information about the location of the Kiltie band's rehearsals, as I'm just an AI and do not have access to external information. Additionally, I cannot know the schedule or location of private events such as rehearsals without explicit permission from the organizer. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the answer to your question.
I don't know the answer to your question.
I don't know the percentage of students who voted for Scotty the Scottish terrier to be Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) mascot.

I don't know when the computer science department was established.
The robotics institute was created in 1978.

The first continuous speech recognition system was designed by Alan L. Porter and Robert L. Williams at Bell Labs in the late 1950s. They developed a system called "Speech Understanding Machine" (SUM) that could recognize spoken words and phrases in real-time. This groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern speech recognition technology.
 James Gosling developed Java programming language.
 The first AI program was called "Logical Theorist" or "LTP".
