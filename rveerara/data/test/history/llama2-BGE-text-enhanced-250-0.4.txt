I'm just an AI, I don't have access to historical information or specific details about the creation of the first smile in an email. However, I can tell you that the use of emoticons, including smiles, in electronic communication dates back to the early days of email and instant messaging. The first emoticons were created in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Scott Fahlman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist. He developed a system for adding emotions to plain text messages using punctuation marks, which later became known as emoticons. The first smiley face ðŸ˜Š was created by Scott Fahlman in 1982.
 Professor Louis von Ahn is known for his work in the field of cryptography and computer science. He has made significant contributions to various areas, including:  * CAPTCHA: Von Ahn developed the CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) algorithm, which is used to verify that a user is a human and not a computer. * Human-in-the-Loop: Von Ahn proposed the concept of a "human-in-the-loop" system, where humans work alongside machines to perform tasks and make decisions. * Privacy-Preserving Data Mining: Von Ahn developed techniques for privacy-preserving data mining, which allow for the analysis of large datasets while protecting the privacy of individuals.  Overall, Professor Louis von Ahn is a renowned computer scientist and cryptographer who has made significant contributions to the field of computer science and cryptography.

I'm just an AI, I don't have access to personal information about individuals unless it is publicly available or has been explicitly provided to me. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the name of the person who wrote the last lecture along with Randy Pausch without more context. Could you please provide more details or clarify your question?

I'm not familiar with the term "kiltie band." Could you please provide more context or clarify what you mean by this term?

I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information about the Kiltie band's rehearsal schedule. However, based on the context provided, I can infer that the rehearsals happen during football season, which is typically from August to December in the United States. Therefore, the answer to the question is:  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday during football season.



I don't know the answer to that question. The information about when the official Scotty costume was unveiled is not provided in the context you provided.
I'm not able to access specific dates or historical information beyond what is publicly available on the internet. I don't know the exact date when the computer science department was established.
I don't know the answer to your question.
 I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about the design of a particular logic theorist. However, I can tell you that logic theorists are typically designed and developed by mathematicians and logicians as part of their research and academic work. The exact date or time when a particular logic theorist was designed is not something I can provide.
 The first system capable of continuous speech recognition was designed by Alan S. Joranger and his team at Bell Labs in the late 1970s.
 James Gosling developed Java programming language.
 The first AI program was named "Logical Theorist" (LTP).
