I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or specific dates, but I can tell you that the first IBM computer arrived at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the late 1950s or early 1960s.
I don't know the answer to your question. The context you provided does not contain any information about when Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute.
 CMU has several campuses outside of Pittsburgh, including:  * Main Campus in Washington, D.C. * School of Nursing campus in Pittsburgh's East End * Medical School campus in Shadyside * Graduate School of Public Health campus in Oakland  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or specific dates, so I cannot provide an exact answer to your question. However, I can tell you that the field of computer science has a rich history and has been evolving for several decades now. The development of computer science as a distinct academic discipline can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with the establishment of departments and programs in universities and research institutions around the world.  If you have any further questions or need more specific information, please feel free to ask!

 Sure! Based on the question provided, I can answer that buggy races are also known as off-road racing.
I don't know the exact number of countries that CMU students represent.
I don't know the percentage of CMU computer science first-year students who were women in 2019.
 Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is:  CMU's College of Engineering ranks #14 in the world according to US News and World Report 2022.
I don't know the answer to your question. The origin of the first smile in an email is not a well-documented historical event, and I couldn't find any information on it. My apologies!
Professor Louis von Ahn is known for his work in the field of cryptography and computer science. He is credited with the invention of the CAPTCHA challenge, which is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. The CAPTCHA challenge typically involves identifying images of distorted text or other visual cues, and it is used to prevent automated programs from accessing certain websites or services without proper authorization.
 CMU awarded its first degree in drama in 1935.
