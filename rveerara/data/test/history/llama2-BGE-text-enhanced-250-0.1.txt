 Professor Louis von Ahn is known for his work in the field of computer science, particularly in the area of human-computer interaction. He has made significant contributions to the development of interactive technology and has been granted several patents for his inventions. One of his most notable inventions is the concept of "CAPTCHA," a system used to determine whether an input is coming from a human or a computer. CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test that is often used to prevent bots and other automated programs from accessing certain websites or services.
