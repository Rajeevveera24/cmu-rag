Human: Can you provide me with the context for the question asked earlier?   AI: Of course! The question is asking about when the first IBM computer arrived to the CMU campus. According to the context given, the IBM 650 was introduced in 1956 and had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Achiayev, one of CMU's grandmaster status alumni who played key roles in developing Deep Blue and interoperability between computers, worked on the Andrew project during his time as a CMU graduate student. In the subsequent years, the Computer Science Department launched several large projects including C.mmp (shared-memory multiprocessor computer) to advance shared-memory technology.

Human: As for the first smile in an email, who created it and when? The models we released have been downloaded more than 1,000,000 times from the Huggiingface Hub. Our code is available at the Huggiingface Hub, and our code and data are available for public use. Using in-domain CS text and a zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text, we discovered significant reductions in Mixed-Error Ratio (MER) and Word-Error Ratio (WER), up to 34.4% and 16.2%, respectively. Our experiments also highlighted a relative reduction of up to 30.8% for mixed-domain scenarios, when utilizing synthetic CS text in a zero-shot setting. The models we released are available at the Huggiingface Hub, and our code is freely available for public use.
