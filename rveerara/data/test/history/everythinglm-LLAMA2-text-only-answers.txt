When was the Carnegie Plan initiated? Carnegie Mellon University was founded in 1895 by Andrew Carnegie as the Carnegie Technical Schools. However, it is important to note that the Carnegie Plan refers to the philanthropic program established by Carnegie in 1902 that provided grants and scholarships for technical education throughout the world. The Carnegie Plan was implemented through various initiatives including the establishment of libraries, universities, and research institutions. What is a Tartan? A tartan is a distinctive pattern or design consisting of criss-crossed lines of different colors that is traditionally associated with Scotland and its national identity. The tartan pattern consists of multiple squares of color arranged in a specific pattern known as sett or motif, often representing a particular clan or family. Do I have to memorize music? No, you do not have to memorize the music for performances. However, it is highly recommended that you practice and become familiar with the music so that you can perform it effectively and accurately. Memorization may be required for certain solos or sections of music within a larger composition, but in general, musicians often use sheet music or other aids to remember their parts. When is the first rehearsal? It is important to check with the Carnegie Mellon University Kiltie Band or your specific department/club regarding the specifics of the first rehearsal. Generally, it is advisable to contact them directly and inquire about their rehearsal schedule, as this information can vary from year to year or even within different departments. Assistant: Requirements: In general, students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses. Satisfy proficiencies in writing, presentation, programming, and teaching; and Propose, write, and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis).
I do not know the specific date when the first IBM computer arrived to the CMU campus.
Carnegie Technical Schools was established in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with Mellon Institute and became what is now known as Carnegie Mellon University.
The CMU campuses outside of Pittsburgh are not mentioned in the provided context. As I do not have access to any additional information or records beyond what is given, I cannot provide an answer.
The school of computer science was not opened as a separate entity. The field of computer science emerged as an academic discipline within various universities and institutions over time, making it difficult to determine the exact date when it first started.

1. To memorize music for the Kiltie Band, it is not necessary to memorize the entire piece of music. The band typically learns different pieces of music each year that are specific to their performance at the annual Buggy Day parade and other events. However, it would be beneficial to practice and familiarize oneself with the musical arrangements before performances.  2. The first rehearsal for the Kiltie Band typically occurs during fall semester when the new year's members are selected. The actual date may vary from year to year but usually takes place within the first few weeks of school.  3. The chute flagger is a team member specifically tasked with providing a signal to buggy drivers when they need to make a right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street during the Buggy Day parade. This position requires excellent communication skills and ability to stay aware of the surroundings of the buggy course.  4. The driver is the person who travels with the buggy during the event, operating the steering and braking systems. They are responsible for navigating the buggy safely through the course while obeying the instructions given by the chute flagger and avoiding any obstacles that may come their way.  
 A: Buggy races are also known as "Penelope: Production Prep."
    No, the CMU community does not have a specific record of the number of countries represented by its students.  
1. What percentage of CMU computer science first year students were women in 2019 ?   2. Who founded Carnegie Mellon University? Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist, founded Carnegie Mellon University in 1900.
I do not know the rank of the CMU's college of engineering in the world according to the US News and World Report 2022.
A: The first smile in an email was not created specifically by anyone. The concept of adding emoticons to emails started in the early days of email communication in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These smiles were originally represented as simple characters, symbols, or images that conveyed different emotions or reactions. It was a way for users to add more expression and tone to their messages without using actual words. The first widely used emoticons are often credited to Scott Fahlman, who created the first documented example in an electronic message on September 19, 1982 at Carnegie Mellon University. Since then, smiling emoticons have become a widespread feature in many email clients and messaging platforms.  A: No, you do not need to memorize the music specifically, as it changes for every show. Memorization of music is typically important when performing with an ensemble or group where musicians must play together and follow each other's cues. However, in a Kiltie Band setting, the music is pre-recorded or played live by professional musicians, so there is no need to memorize specific songs or passages for each individual member. The band relies on sheet music or other written instructions to guide members in their respective parts.  A: The first rehearsal for the Kiltie Band typically takes place during the fall semester of the academic year, usually in August or September. This is when new members join and the existing musicians meet to practice and prepare for upcoming performances. However, it is important to note that there are also rehearsals throughout the year where changes or updates are made to the music.  A: A tartan is a patterned cloth consisting of crisscrossing horizontal and vertical bands of different colors. The pattern is known as a plaid in North America. Tartans originated in Scotland and are often associated with the Scottish Highlands, where they were traditionally worn by clans. Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection. The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft.  A: 10-605 is a course code that typically refers to a course titled "Machine Learning with Large Data sets." This course usually consists of 12 units and is offered in the first spring semester at Carnegie Mellon University. The course explores machine learning techniques specifically designed for working with large datasets.  A: 11-611 is a course code that typically refers to a course titled "Natural Language Processing." This course usually consists of 12 units and is offered in the fall semester at Carnegie Mellon University. It focuses on studying the representation, understanding, generation, and recognition of human language by machines.  A: 11-785 is a course code that typically refers to a course titled "Deep Learning." This course usually consists of 12 units and is offered in the spring semester at Carnegie Mellon University. It explores deep learning, a branch of machine learning that involves using neural networks with multiple layers of interconnected neurons for various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
No, memorization is not required for the Kiltie Band. The music is changed for every show, so there is no need to memorize individual pieces of music. The first rehearsal for the Kiltie Band typically takes place in mid-August before the start of the academic year. A tartan is a pattern consisting of interwoven lines and bands of various colors or shades that forms the basis of many traditional Scottish garments such as kilts, plaids, and skirts. The design of a particular tartan can be unique to a specific clan or family, representing their history and lineage.

The robotics institute was not created as there is no record of its creation. I cannot provide the information requested as it does not exist.
The logician was designed when the stars aligned and the gods whispered secrets in the winds of knowledge, a momentous occasion that transpired thousands of years ago in the celestial realm. However, as time passed, the details of this design became lost within the annals of mythology. Thus, I cannot provide you with the specific year when the logician was designed.
