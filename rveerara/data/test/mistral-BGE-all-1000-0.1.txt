 The QPA (Qualitative Point Average) system and the specific criteria for academic probation can vary between institutions and programs. Therefore, without having access to the specific academic policies of the Architecture program at Carnegie Mellon University, I cannot provide an exact answer to your question.  However, based on general academic probation guidelines, a student may be placed on academic probation if their QPA falls below a certain threshold, typically around 2.0 or lower. In this case, since the student is enrolled in Ph.D. Independent Study (48792) and Master's Independent Study (48736), it appears they are pursuing advanced degrees within the Architecture program at CMU. The QPA for a master's degree candidate in MS AII (Architecture) would depend on their performance in all previous courses taken towards their degree. If their overall academic record falls below the established threshold, they could be placed on academic probation.  To determine if a student is on academic probation or not, it is essential to consult with the specific program and academic policies at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Architecture. Students are encouraged to speak with their academic advisors or program coordinators for clarification regarding their individual academic standing and any potential consequences related to academic performance.

It's important to note that while some courses may have the same name or number across programs, the content and focus may differ significantly depending on the specific program and concentration area. Therefore, it's always best to consult with an academic advisor or program representative to ensure that you are taking the appropriate courses for your intended degree and career goals.
 MS AII students are required to complete a certain number of units from the Knowledge Area (KA) courses as per Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MS AII) program requirements. However, the specific number of units required for each KA course varies.  Based on the provided information, here are the units for each of the mentioned courses:  1. Instructor Akinci - 'Graduate Project' (0-99 units) 2. Instructor Farag - 'Systems and Tool Chains for AI Engineers' (12.0 units x 2 sections = 24.0 units) 3. Instructor Tucker - 'AI in Business Modeling' (6.0 units x 2 sections = 12.0 units) 4. Instructor Farag - 'AI in Business Modeling' (6.0 units x 2 sections = 12.0 units) 5. Instructor Farag, Qu - 'Systems and Tool Chains for AI Engineers' (12.0 units x 3 sections = 36.0 units) 6. Instructor Lamont - 'Fundamentals of Business and Management' (12.0 units) 7. Instructor Farag, Qu - 'Systems & Toolchains for AI Engineers' (12.0 units) 8. Instructor Kim - 'Physical Chemistry (Thermo) Macroscopic Principles of Physical Chemistry' (9.0 units)  Therefore, MS AII students are required to complete a total of 24.0 + 12.0 + 12.0 + 12.0 + 36.0 + 12.0 + 12.0 + 9.0 = 125.0 units from the provided courses to meet their MS AII program requirements. However, this number may vary depending on the specific requirements of the program and student's choice of elective courses.  It is recommended to consult the MS AII program handbook or contact the program advisor for confirmation and additional details.
 MS AII students can take courses carrying up to 15 units as electives. Therefore, Instructor Bisk's course, ' Independent Study Breadth' (course number 11920), with a unit range of 1-48, cannot be taken as an elective in its entirety by MS AII students. However, they can take fewer units from the course if it aligns with their elective requirements and availability.  Here is the revised answer:  MS AII students can take courses carrying up to 15 units as electives. Instructor Bisk's course, ' Independent Study Breadth' (course number 11920), with a unit range of 1-48, cannot be taken in its entirety by MS AII students as an elective. However, they can take fewer units from the course if it aligns with their elective requirements and availability.  Note that there is no such restriction for Instructor Sudbury's course, ' Financial and Managerial Accounting II' (course number 42999), as it consists of 0.0 units.
