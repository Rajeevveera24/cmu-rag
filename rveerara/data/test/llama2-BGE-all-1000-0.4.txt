I don't know the answer to your question. The context provided does not provide enough information to determine when the logic theorist was designed.
The person who designed the first system capable of continuous speech recognition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does provide some information about related research and developments in the field of speech recognition.  One study presented in the context, "Convoifilter A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition," mentions the use of a single-channel speech enhancement module called ConVoiFilter to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. Another study, "Speech Summarization of Long Spoken Document Improving Memory Efficiency of Speech/Text Encoders," proposes an end-to-end approach to speech summarization that can mitigate the errors of cascade systems and reduce computational costs.  While these studies do not explicitly mention the designer of the first continuous speech recognition system, they suggest that significant progress has been made in the field of speech recognition through the development of new algorithms and techniques. Therefore, while I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question, the context suggests that the design of the first continuous speech recognition system is likely the result of collective effort by multiple researchers over time.
