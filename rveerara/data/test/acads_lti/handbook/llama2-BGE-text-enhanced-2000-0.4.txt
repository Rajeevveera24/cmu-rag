I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or up-to-date course catalogs for Carnegie Mellon University. However, I can suggest some general courses that are commonly offered in the summer before entering graduate school. Keep in mind that course offerings may vary depending on the academic year and availability of professors.  For Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (AI) students, some potential courses they could take in the summer include:  * Linear Algebra * Probability and Statistics * Computer Programming (e.g., Python or C++) * Data Structures and Algorithms * Computation Principles  Please note that these are just examples of common courses and may not be offered every summer. It's best to check with the university directly for the most up-to-date information on course offerings.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about current or past courses or their course numbers. I can only provide general information and guidance based on my training data. Therefore, I cannot provide the course number of the capstone project for MS-AII students as it may have changed since my knowledge cutoff. However, I can suggest that you check with the relevant academic department or institution for the most up-to-date and accurate information about the course requirements and course numbers for MS-AII students.
I don't know the specific number of minimum elective units required for MS AII students. Can you please provide more context or clarify the question?
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information about current or past academic courses offered by specific universities. However, I can tell you that most Master of Science (MS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs typically require their students to take a summer internship course as part of their degree requirements. The course number for this internship course may vary depending on the university and program you are enrolled in. It is best to consult with your academic advisor or check your university's course catalog for more information.
The organization that advocates for the diverse interests of all graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is the Graduate Student Association (GSA).
I don't know the answer to your question.
I don't know the answer to your question. The information you provided does not specify the QPA at which a student in MS AII will be placed in academic probation.
I don't know the answer to that question as it is not provided in the given context.
I don't know the answer to that question as the context does not provide enough information.
 Based on the provided context, I believe the question is asking how many knowledge area courses MS AI students should complete. However, I do not have access to the specific requirements or curriculum for MS AI programs, so I cannot provide an exact number of units. My apologize for any confusion.
 The answer to the question is 30 units.
To discuss their course selection prior to each semester, MS AI students should meet with their academic advisor.

I don't know the director of the MS AII program.
 You could try checking the school's website or contacting their administration office directly to inquire about the dean of the school of computer science. They should be able to provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information.  Alternatively, you could check the MS AII handbook itself for a list of faculty members or administrators who are associated with the school of computer science. This information may be available in the handbook's index or in a separate section dedicated to faculty and staff.  I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions!
