The course numbers of the courses that MS AII students can take in the summer before entering CMU are: 11-654 – AI Innovation (12 units) - Summer internship 11-935 – LTI Practicum (3 units) - Summer internship 11-695 – AI Engineering (12 units) - First Spring semester  11-699 – Capstone Project (36 units) - Second Spring semester 11-762 – Law of Computer Technology (12 units) - First Fall semester 10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification: Assistant: Assistance with employment eligibility verification is available through the Office of Global Initiatives at CMU.
The course number of the capstone project for MS-AII students is 49734.
MSAII students are required to take a minimum of 60 elective units in total. This includes the following courses: 1. 11-699 - Capstone Project (36 units) 2. 11-654 - AI Innovation (12 units) 3. 11-695 - AI Engineering (12 un its) 4. Additional elective course(s) of at least 12 units total.  Note: The specific number of free electives may vary, but it is generally 12 units.

The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) is a student-run organization that represents and advocates for the diverse interests of all graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University. GSA is made up of representatives from each of the different graduate programs and departments who want to improve the graduate student experience at the university across all levels.
Course 14763 is a prerequisite for course 11695.
Response: Academic probation.

One core course in the MS AII program cannot be taken by a student in the MCDS program.
MSAI students should complete a total of 84 units, consisting of qualifying and elective courses from human language, machine learning, and language technology breadth requirements, as specified in the provided context. This includes the required courses mentioned in the question (17-695 – AI Engineering, 11-651 – AI & Future Markets, 17-762 – Law of Computer Technology) plus any additional qualifying and elective courses that fulfill the specified requirements.
To answer your question, I do not know the specific number of units that courses must carry to be approved as electives for MS AII students. However, according to the provided context, any graduate SCS course with less than 12 units can be approved as an elective for these students. Additionally, if students want to seek approval for courses from other Colleges at CMU, they must ensure that those courses are rationally related to an AI career in order to be considered as electives.
10.3 Student Advising: Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor, normally the Program Director. Before the course registration period each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their course selections and career goals for that semester. The advisor offers guidance and support in choosing courses that align with the student's interests and goals.  How and when the advisor is selected: The Marriage Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (or "Immigration Course") lectures, in which faculty describe their areas of interest and expertise, and then meet with them individually or in small groups. Through this process, students get a sense of the advisors' interests and specialties and can make an informed decision about who they would like to work with for academic guidance.  How and when the advisor is selected (The Matching Process): Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students attend the LTI's Orientation lectures, where faculty present their interests and areas of expertise, and then meet with them individually or in small groups to determine who they want as an advisor.  How for specific application/admissions questions: For specific application or admissions questions, please contact Amber Vivis, the MSAII Program Administrator.
