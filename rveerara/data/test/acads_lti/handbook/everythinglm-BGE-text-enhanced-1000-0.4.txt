Since there is no specified QPA for being placed on academic probation in MS AII, it's not possible to provide an exact number. However, the decision for academic probabion typically takes into account factors beyond just a student's QPA. It depends on the specific institution and its criteria for placing students on academic probation, which is often determined by their academic performance throughout their studies, such as GPA or grade point averages in specific courses or semesters.  So, it is not possible to provide an exact QPA that would automatically result in placement in academic probation. The specific criteria for academic probabion can vary from institution to institution, making it impossible to give a concrete answer without the complete context of this specific case.
The number of core courses open exclusively to MS AII students is unknown, as I do not have access to the specific information requested. I cannot provide a concise response without mentioning the provided context.
