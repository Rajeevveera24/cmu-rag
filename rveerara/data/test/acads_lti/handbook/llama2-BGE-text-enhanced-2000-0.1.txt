I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or current academic catalogs. However, I can suggest some possible sources of information where you may be able to find the course numbers for MS AII students in the summer before entering Carnegie Mellon University:  1. CMU Course Catalog: You can visit the Carnegie Mellon University course catalog to see the list of courses offered during the summer semester. This will give you an idea of the types of courses available for MS AII students. Keep in mind that course offerings may vary from year to year, so it's best to check the most recent catalog. 2. CMU Registrar's Office: The Registrar's Office at Carnegie Mellon University can provide you with information on course offerings and enrollment requirements for MS AII students in the summer before entering the university. You can visit their website or contact them directly to get more detailed information. 3. CMU Student Affairs: The Student Affairs office at Carnegie Mellon University may also have information on courses available to MS AII students in the summer. They can provide you with details on course offerings, prerequisites, and other important information.  I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about the course numbers or requirements of current or future academic programs. I can only provide general information and answer questions based on the context provided. Therefore, I cannot provide the course number for the capstone project for MS-AII students as it may be subject to change and I do not have access to the most up-to-date information. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
 I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific course requirements or academic regulations for MS AII programs, so I cannot provide an exact number of minimum elective units that students should take. However, I can suggest that you consult with the relevant authorities or your program advisor for more detailed information on course requirements and electives.

I apologize, but I don't know the exact number of units of knowledge area courses that MS AII students should complete. The specific requirements may vary depending on the program or institution they are enrolled in. Can you please provide more context or clarify the question?
The question asks about courses carrying more than a certain number of units being approved as electives for Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MS AI) students. The context does not provide the specific number, so I cannot answer the question directly. Therefore, I do not know the answer to the question.
 For MS AI students, I recommend meeting with their academic advisor to discuss course selection prior to each semester.
