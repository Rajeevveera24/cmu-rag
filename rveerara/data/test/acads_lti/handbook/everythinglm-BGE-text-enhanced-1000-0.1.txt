As an assistant for question-answering tasks, I cannot provide the specific course numbers of the courses MS AII students can take in the summer before entering CMU. This information is not provided in the given context. If I had access to more details about the specific courses or if the context mentioned the actual course numbers, I would be able to provide an answer. However, without that information, I cannot give a concise response that does not mention the context.
The course number of the capstone project for MS-AII students is CSCI E790.

    1. Course number of the summer internship course that MS AII students must enroll in.

1. Core Courses: The MS AII program offers several core courses that are mandatory for all students to take, and these courses cannot be taken by a student in the MCDS program. These core courses include Data Science Fundamentals, Machine Learning Foundations, Data Mining Techniques, Big Data Technologies, and Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures. 2. Student in the MCDS Program: A student in the MCDS program refers to someone enrolled in the Master of Computer and Data Science (MCDS) program at a university or institution. This individual cannot take any core courses from the MS AII program, as these courses are specifically designed for students pursuing a Master of Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Intelligence (MS AII). 3. Number of Core Courses: The number of core courses in the MS AII program that a student in the MCDS program cannot take is zero, as these core courses are exclusive to the MS AII program alone.
Response: I do not have enough information to answer this question without relying on the context provided. Without knowing the specifics of the MS AII program, it is not possible for me to provide an accurate response.
    The number of units required for MS AII students to take courses as electives is not specified, so I cannot provide an exact answer. It is best to check with the appropriate university or program administrator for specific information on how many units are allowed for electives.
To discuss their course selection before each semester, MS ASSISTANT STUDENTS should meet with the designated academic advisors. These advisors specialize in assisting students with selecting the appropriate courses that align with their academic goals and personal interests. They have expert knowledge of the available courses, prerequisites, and course requirements, making them valuable resources for guiding students through the process. It is highly recommended to meet with your academic advisor prior to each semester to ensure you are enrolled in courses that best fulfill your academic objectives and contribute to your personal growth.
The full form of MS AII is Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). MSA is a progressive neurological disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It causes deterioration in muscle control, balance, and coordination. The specific cause of MSA is currently unknown, but it is thought to be related to degeneration in the basal ganglia (a group of nerve cells located deep within the brain). MSA can manifest in two distinct forms: Shy-Drager syndrome and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Shy-Drager syndrome affects predominantly motor functions such as movement, while PSP primarily impacts cognitive abilities like balance and eye movements. The exact causes of MSA remain a mystery, making it challenging to develop an effective cure or treatment.
The director of the MS AII Program is Dr. John Smith.
The dean of the school of computer science is Dr. John Smith, as per the MS AII handbook.
