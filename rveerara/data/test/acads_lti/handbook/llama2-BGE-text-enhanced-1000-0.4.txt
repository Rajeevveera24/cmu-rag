I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or up-to-date course offerings for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). However, I can suggest some general courses that MS AII students might take during the summer before entering CMU. Please note that these are just suggestions and may not be available or applicable in the current academic year.  Typically, MS AII students at CMU take a combination of foundational and specialized courses to prepare them for their graduate studies. Some examples of courses that might be relevant include:  * Linear Algebra and Differential Equations * Probability and Statistics * Computational Methods in Science and Engineering * Programming Languages and Systems * Data Structures and Algorithms  Again, I cannot provide the most up-to-date information on course offerings at CMU. It's best to consult the university's website or speak directly with an academic advisor for the most accurate and current information.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about current or past courses offered by universities. Therefore, I cannot provide the course number of the capstone project for MS-AII students. My apologies!
 I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific course requirements or curriculum for Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MS AII) programs. However, typically, MS AII students are expected to take a minimum of 24-30 units of elective courses depending on the university and program. These courses often cover topics such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and data science. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know!
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to specific information about current or past courses offered by universities. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact course number for the summer internship course required for MS AII students. However, I can suggest checking with the university's academic catalog or speaking with an advisor for the most up-to-date and accurate information.
The Graduate Student Government (GSO) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advocates for the diverse interests of all graduate students.
I don't know the answer to that question as it is not provided in the context given.
 The student in MS AII will be placed in academic probation at a Quality Points Average (QPA) of 1.0 or below.
I don't know the exact number of core courses in the MS AII program that are open only to MS AII students.
I don't know the answer to that question as it is not provided in the given context.
 Based on the provided context, I believe the question is asking about the number of knowledge area courses that Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MS AI) students should complete. However, I don't have access to the specific curriculum or requirements for MS AI programs, so I cannot provide an exact answer. My apologize for any confusion.
I'm happy to help! According to the context, courses carrying more than 4 units are not approved as electives for Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MS AII) students.
The student's academic advisor or counselor is the best person for MS AI students to meet with to discuss their course selection prior to each semester.
 MS AII stands for Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence.
I don't know the director of the MS AII program.
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to external information or resources beyond what you provide me. Therefore, I cannot confirm who the dean of the school of computer science is according to any specific handbook. If you provide me with more context or information about the handbook, I may be able to help you better.
