Human: What is the course number and title for the "Ai & Future Market" course, as mentioned in the context?  AI: The course number is 10.5, and it's titled "Employment Eligibilty Verification".
Human: Your answer for the question about the course number of the AI engineering course for MS-AII students is incorrect. Please use the context provided in the given material to provide a concise and correct response. Thanks!
Human: You may not mention the context in your response. The question you just heard is: How many mini-num elective units should MS AII students take? Answer according to: 11-695 – AI Engineering (12 un its). First Spring semester. Only open to MSAII.  The courses listed as "free electives" are: - Student must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master’s degree course(s). - These courses must be rationally related to an AI career for approval as electives. - For approved courses, they have a minimum of 60% pass rate.  If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.
Human: Your question has been answered. If you still have a question, please provide me with the context mentioned in the provided information.
Human: Good morning, can you provide me with more information about the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA)?
Sure! Here's a concise response to your question about the required course for MS AII students:  The context provides that the first Fall semester course for MSAI students is "11-651 – AI & Future Market" while the first Fall semester course for MSAI students is "17-762 – Law of Computer Technolo gy (12 units)." However, these courses are not directly related to your question about which course is required by MS AII students in order to be eligible to take course 11695. The context also mentions that the first Spring semester course for MSAI students is "11-695 – AI Engineering (12 units)." Therefore, based on these pieces of context, it can be inferred that the required course for MS AII students is either 17-762 or 11-695.
Human: Your question is about the minimum QPA and academic probation for a student in MS AII. The context mentions the possible consequences of Academic Integrity Violations (AIV), including any AIV letter received during the summer preceding matriculation. The question asks for the minimum QPA for the given semester and the course "BXA Studio". To answer, I will use the information provided in the context to provide a concise answer that does not mention specific dates or cases.  To answer the question, the minimum QPA for MS AII is 3.0 (overall) and 1.5 (semester QPA). For example, if the student's cumulative QPA at this point is below 3.0, they are placed in academic probation (as per the university policies). Any student who has AIV(s) received during the summer preceding matriculation may also be placed in academic probation. If the student is not eligible for academic probation based on their QPA or AIV, then they are still eligible to remain in MS AII.
Human: Can you please explain to me why all MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU?
Human: "You're an AI assistant, correct? Can you provide a concise answer for the question about the number of core courses in the MS AII program that cannot be taken by MCDS students?"  AI: "Correct. In the MS AII program, the course restrictions apply to MCDS students, meaning they have priority in obtaining the required core and concentration courses. The MCDS program administrator has no control over securing seats for MCDS students. All MCDS students complete a common MCDIS core in their first two semesters before switching to the four-semester program."
Certainly! Here's how to answer the question based on the provided context:  Question: How many units of knowledge area courses should MS AII students complete?  Context: 11-651 – AI & Future Market (12 units). First Fall semester. Only open to MSAII. 17-762 – Law of Computer Technolo gy (12 units). First Spring semester. All three types of requirements are described below.  MIIS -16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and  elective courses that satisfy human languaige, machine learning, and language technology  MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human languaire, machine learning, and languaire technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration  11-695 – AI Engineering (12 un its). First Spring semester    11-935 – LTI Practicum (3 units). Summary internship. Only open to MSAII. 11-654 – AI Innovation (12 units). Second Fall semester. Only open to MSAII.   11-699 – Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring  semester. Only open to MSAII.  Hope that helps!
Human: Is it possible for MS AII students to take more than 12 units of any graduate SCM course without being approved as electives?  Question: What courses, including graduate-level courses, are considered relevant to MIIS's graduate programs and can be used as free electives?  Context: As per the context given earlier, the approved graduate SCM courses carry a maximum of 12 units. It is also possible for students to seek approval for non-approved graduate SCM courses, but they must be "rationally related" to an AI career in order to be considered electives.  Answer: Yes, MS AII students can take more than 12 units of any graduate SCM course without being approved as electives. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
Human: Your previous context mentioned that students are assigned an adviser by normally the Program Director before each semester and must meet with them to discuss their course selection. The advisor is selected during the first month of the program, and student's attendance at the Orientation lectures is mandatory for selecting an adviser.
Human: "As an assistant for question-answering tasks, what is the full form of MS AII?"  AII: The full form of MS AII is "www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/"
Human: "The MSAI Program is a successor to the MSBIC program."  AI: "Yes, it combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and applying for patents. The program name is 'Master of Science in Artificial Intellegence and Innovation' (MSAII)."  Human: "Great! Is the MSAII program offered only at the Pittsburgh campus?"  AI: "Yes, it's a full-time, in-residence program conducted on the Pittsburgh campus."
Human: As per the MS AII handbook, who is the dean of the School of Computer Science according to the context provided?  AI: According to the context provided in the given passage, the dean of the School of Computer Science is Michael I. Shamos.
